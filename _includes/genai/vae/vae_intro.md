### What is expectation of a random variable?

1. Say we roll a die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
2. Probability of each outcome is 1/6.
3. Therefore if we would like to find the contribution of each number in the die to the expected outcome, we would multiply each number by its probability:
   $1 * \frac{1}{6} + 2 * \frac{1}{6} + 3 * \frac{1}{6} + 4 * \frac{1}{6} + 5 * \frac{1}{6} + 6 * (1/6) = $
