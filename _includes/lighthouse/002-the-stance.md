#### 1. The awakening of Meaning 
>“The truth of the Universe is human truth.”
— The Religion of Man

The world is mute till meaning wakes,
A hush that waits for paths we take;
Not forged by cause, nor bound by blame,
Life blooms the hour we choose its name.

#### 2. Freedom from the tyranny of past
>“Man is not a beggar sitting at the door of the past.”
— The Religion of Man

No past commands the breath of now,
It only shows a learned “how”;
The heart decides, in quiet art,
Which way to turn, which role to start.

#### 3. The relational vastness & awe
>“The self is realized in its unity with others.”
— The Religion of Man

When self stands small, it aches alone,
A fragile throne of brittle stone;
When stretched in care, in shared design,
The soul grows wide, the stars align.

#### 4. Immanence of the divine in life
>“He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground 
and where the path-maker is breaking stones.”
— Gitanjali, poem 11

Not found above, nor lost below,
The sacred moves where choices go;
In work, in love, in hands that give,
The infinite learns how to live.

#### 5. Comradeship of all beings
>“I shall never allow myself to be insulted 
by the glorification of my bondage.”
— Nationalism

To walk with all, not rise in rank,
To serve the field, not guard the bank;
This stance, once chosen, makes us whole—
A healed world circling one soul.

#### 6. Courageous embrace of life
>“Faith is the bird that feels the light 
and sings when the dawn is still dark.”
— Fireflies

So meaning sings where courage stood,
Where fear was met by brotherhood;
The human way, the cosmic art—
One life, one choice, one open heart.

#### 7. The Divine Woven into Humanity
>“God finds himself in man.”
— The Religion of Man

No distant throne in silent skies,
No lonely lord beyond our cries;
In human touch, in shared delight,
The Infinite puts on our sight.

God leans into the human face,
Finds form in love, in time, in place;
Where joy is made, where wounds are healed,
The heart becomes the holy field.

#### 8. The Universe Made Human
>“The Universe is not merely law, 
it is a person.”
— The Religion of Man

The stars grow near when hearts expand,
The cosmos learns to take a hand;
Through song and toil, through thought and care,
Man gives the vast a home somewhere.

Not man to God, nor God apart,
But God awakened in the heart;
The world is whole when this is known—
The universe walks flesh and bone.
