## Gita - 10.40 - Divine Manifestations

There is no end to My divine manifestations, Arjuna.  
This has been declared by Me,   
As an example of the extent   
Of My Manifestations.   

The beautiful and the scary  
The Loving and hateful  
Light and dark  
All are the manifestations of Thou.  
And I Love Thine, in Thy entirety.  

In the deepest of the despair   
of last dark hopeless night,  
And in the golden glow of the highest hope,  
Equanimous, I meditate  
Beyond the noise,  
In that primordial silence,  
Where there is nothing,   
But acceptance, love and light!
