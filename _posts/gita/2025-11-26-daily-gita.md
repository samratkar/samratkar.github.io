## Gita - 10.40 - Divine Manifestations

There is no end to My divine manifestations, Arjuna.  
This has been declared by Me,   
As an example of the extent   
Of My Manifestations.   

The beautiful and the scary  
The Loving and hateful  
Light and dark  
All are the manifestations of Thou.  
And I Love Thine, in Thy entirety.  

In the deepest of the despair   
of last dark hopeless night,  
And in the golden glow of the highest hope,  
Equanimous, I meditate  
Beyond the noise,  
In that primordial silence,  
Where there is nothing,  
But acceptance, love and light!   


## Gita - Chapter 16 - The Distinction between Divine & Demonic Tendencies 
Arjuna, there are two kinds of created beings  
In this world -   
The Divine and the Demonic.  
The Divine leads to liberation and lightness.  
The Demonic leads to bondage and burden.  

## Part 1 - Divine Tendencies - The realm to Be! And to Love!
A man who adopts the tendencies towards the Divine, Arjuna,  

### Courage, Perseverance & Love for learning
Is **fearless** and **pure** in heart.   
He **perseveres** in that path to knowledge,   
And to the union with **stillness and awareness** within,  
By **studying** and practicing   
what the **great books** and   
his **teachers** have taught him.  
They first **meditate, focus, and learn.**  
And then they **act** upon them with **wisdom** and **awareness**.    

### Austere, Sacrificing & Self-restrained 
He is **austere**, **upright** and **generous**,  
He practices **self-restraint** and **sacrifice**.  
His passions are **sanctified**,  
Out of his persistent practice,  
Of spiritual discipline of **Love**.   
He is **straightforward**, **truthful**.  
He is **free from greed and covetousness**.  

### Gentle, Compassionate & Loving
He is **absent of anger, calumny and malice**.  
He **harms no one**.  
He is **gentle**, **modest** and **upright**.  
He is **not bound with the fetters**  
Of the things of this world.  
He has a **tranquil mind,**  
And an **unmalicious tongue.**   
He is **compassionate** towards all.  
He can **forgive** and **endure**.  
He **abstains from useless activities**.  
He has **faith** in the strength of his higher nature.  
He is **clean** in thought and act.  
He is **free from hatred and from pride.**  

### Lightness, freedom & joyful bliss
He is not constricted, with narrow selfish desires,  
Laden with the burdens of anxiety and fear.   
Rather he is **free, open, light, creative**,   
And exhibits **love, vigor, vitality, fortitude and endurance**.   
Such qualities leads to a life of **lightness**,  
**liberation, freedom and joyful bliss.**  

## Part 2 - Demonic Tendencies  - The Realm to Have! And to fear!
### Self preservation & self-gratification  
Demonic men do not understand   
When to act and when to refrain from action.   
He is filled with hypocrisy, arrogance,   
conceit, anger, cruelty and ignorance.  
There is purity, no good conduct,   
Nor Truth, is found in them.   
They are a dried up lake,  
With no water to offer to anyone.   
Their lives are for only,  
Self preservation and self-gratification.  

### Self created ossification & separation 
They build up walls of fear, hatred and pride,  
And are obstinate in their views.  
They manipulate people, and look down upon them,  
With a sense of false superiority.  
They are envious of others.  

### The heavy bondage of desires & anxieties
Bound by a heavy hundred snares of desires -    
lower selfish material ones,    
Devoted to desire, lust and anger,    
They seek to obtain,    
By unjust means, Hoards of possessions,    
For gratification and consummation alone.  

The anxiety binds them with  
A hundred chains delivering them over to   
Lust and Wrath.   
They are ceaselessly busy,  
Piling up dishonest gains   
To satisfy their cravings,  
And protect themselves from their own fears.  

### The Eternal Hell
They are addicts of sensual pleasure,  
Made restless by their many desires.   
And caught in the net of delusion.  
They fall into filthy hell of their own evil minds.   
This eternal vicious cycle of consummated existence     
of busy-ness, violence, war,   
gratification, heaviness and anxiety    
is there for their curse.    
This leads them to ever more bondage.   

They get trapped in the vicious cycle,  
Of having and losing,  
And having more and losing more.   
They never are able to break free from this cycle,  
Of pain, anxiety and despair.  
That is their eternal hell.    
With the three doors -   
Lust, rage and greed.  


### The self defeating journey
Their journey starts with selfish desires,     
And ends with self-gratification.   
And the cycle continues.    
Interspersed anxiety, depression, listlessness, and despair,  
When things do not go as per their little selfish plans.  
And limitless pride, arrogance and and a will to get more,    
When things go their way.  

### The dogma of utility, destruction & power
They believe the universe is without   
An inherent beauty, or an ethical aesthetics.  
Rather the world is brought about by  
Utility, transactions, power, violence and lust alone.  
This false belief makes them cruel,   
and of limited intelligence,  
Leading them to destructive actions.   
They make numerable enemies.   

### The addiction to just have 
Being maligned and full of egoism, vanity  
Lust, wrath and consciousness of power,  
They loathe hidden Divine aesthetics   
That prevails in all creation.  
They deny My presence -   
Both in themselves and in others.  

They are enemies of both mankind and Myself.  
Denying the profound spiritual reality,  
Of My immanence and transcendence.  
In everything outside and within.   

Instead, only for outward show,  
And to appease their own dogmas,    
They perform charity, do rituals   
And visit temples.  
All as a conceit,   
To make their uncertain future secure,  
To have more, be safe,   
and avoid death & destruction.  
Their pursuit towards Me,   
Is only for selfish ends.  
They are just takers.   
From the world,   
And from Me!  

### Ever Thirsty & never content
Their lust can never be appeased.  
They are arrogant, and vain  
And drunk with pride.  
They run blindly after what is evil.  
The ends they work for are unclean,  
Guided by just one agenda -   
self gratification of the senses.  
And so, they are plagued by innumerable cares,  
From which death alone can release them.   

### The self talk of the ignorant 
Arjuna - Being blind in their ignorance,   
their self talk is like the following -  

I wanted this and today I got it.  
I want that : I shall get it tomorrow.   
All these riches are now mine :   
Soon I shall have more.  
I have killed this enemy.   
I will kill all the rest.    
I am a ruler of men.    
I enjoy the things of this world.    
I am successful, strong and happy.   
Who is my equal?    
I am so wealthy and so nobly born.    
I will sacrifice to the Gods.    
I will give alms.    
I will make merry.
