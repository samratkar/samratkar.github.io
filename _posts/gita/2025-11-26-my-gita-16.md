## Gita - Chapter 16 - The Distinction between Divine & Demonic Tendencies

---

Arjuna, there are two kinds of states  
Beings come to possess in this world -  
The Divine and the Demonic.  
The Divine state leads to liberation and lightness.  
The Demonic state leads to bondage and burden.    

## Part 1 - Divine Tendencies - The realm to Be! And to Love!
People when they adopt the tendencies towards the Divine, Arjuna, they exhibit the following qualities -  

### Courage, Perseverance & Love for learning
They become **fearless** and **pure** in heart.   
They **persevere** in that path to knowledge,   
And to the union with **stillness and awareness** within,  
By **studying** and practicing   
what the **great books** and   
their **teachers** have taught them.  
They first **meditate, focus, and learn.**  
And then they **act** upon them with **wisdom** and **awareness**.    

### Austere, Sacrificing & Self-restrained 
They are **austere**, **upright** and **generous**,  
They practice **self-restraint** and **sacrifice**.  
Their passions are **sanctified**,  
Out of their persistent practice,  
Of spiritual discipline of **Love**.   
They are **straightforward**, **truthful**.  
They are **free from greed and covetousness**.  

### Gentle, Compassionate & Loving
They are **absent of anger, calumny and malice**.  
They **harm no one**.  
They are **gentle**, **modest** and **upright**.  
They are **not bound with the fetters**  
Of the things of this world.  
They have a **tranquil mind,**  
And an **unmalicious tongue.**   
They are **compassionate** towards all.
They can **forgive** and **endure**.  
They **abstain from useless activities**.  
They have **faith** in the strength of their higher nature.  
They are **clean** in thought and act.  
They are **free from hatred and from pride.**  
### Lightness, freedom & joyful bliss
They are not constricted, with narrow selfish desires,  
Laden with the burdens of anxiety and fear.   
Rather they are **free, open, light, creative**,   
And exhibit **love, vigor, vitality, fortitude and endurance**.   
Such qualities leads to a life of **lightness**,  
**liberation, freedom and joyful bliss.**  

## Part 2 - Demonic Tendencies  - The Realm to Have! And to fear!
People when they adopt the tendencies towards the Demonic, Arjuna, they exhibit the following qualities -

### Self preservation & self-gratification  
Demonic men do not understand   
When to act and when to refrain from action.   
They are filled with **hypocrisy, arrogance**,   
**conceit, anger, cruelty and ignorance**.  
There is no purity, no good conduct,   
Nor Truth, is found in them.   
They are a **dried up lake**,  
With no water to offer to anyone.   
Their lives are for only,  
**Self-preservation and self-gratification**.  

### Self created ossification & separation 
They build up walls of **fear, hatred and pride**,  
And are obstinate in their views.  
They **manipulate** people, and look **down upon** them,  
With a sense of **false superiority**.  
They are **envious** of others.  

### The heavy bondage of desires & anxieties
Bound by a heavy hundred **snares of desires** -    
lower selfish material ones,    
Devoted to desire, **lust and anger**,    
They seek to obtain,    
By unjust means, **hoards of possessions**,    
For gratification and **consummation** alone.  

The anxiety binds them with  
A hundred chains delivering them over to   
**Lust and Wrath**.   
They are **ceaselessly busy**,  
Piling up dishonest gains   
To satisfy their **cravings**,  
And protect themselves from their own **fears**.  

### The Eternal Hell
They are **addicts** of sensual **pleasure**,  
Made **restless** by their many desires.   
And **caught** in the net of delusion.  
They fall into **hell** of their own **minds**.   
This eternal vicious cycle of consummated existence     
of **busy-ness, violence, war,**   
**gratification, heaviness and anxiety **   
is their destined eternal **curse**.    
This leads them to ever more **bondage**.   

They get trapped in the vicious **cycle**,  
Of **having and losing**,  
And having more and losing more.   
They never are able to break free from this cycle,  
Of pain, anxiety and despair.  
That is their eternal hell.    
With the three doors -   
**Lust, rage and greed.**  


### The self defeating journey
Their journey starts with **selfish desires**,     
And ends with **self-gratification**.   
And the cycle continues.    
Interspersed **anxiety, depression, listlessness, and despair**,  
When things do not go as per their little **selfish plans.**  
And limitless **arrogance** and **greed** 
In that renewed will to get more,    
When things go their way.  

### The dogma of utility, destruction & power
They believe the universe is without   
An inherent beauty, or an **ethical aesthetics**.  
Rather the world is brought about by  
**Utility, transactions, power, violence and lust alone**.  
This false belief makes them **cruel**,   
and of limited intelligence,  
Leading them to **destructive** actions.   
They make numerable **enemies**.   

### The addiction to just have 
Being maligned and full of **egoism, vanity**  
Lust, wrath and **consciousness of power**,  
They **loathe** hidden Divine aesthetics   
That prevails in all creation.  
They **deny** My presence -   
Both in **themselves and in others.**  

They become enemies of both mankind and Myself.  
Denying the profound spiritual reality,  
Of My immanence and transcendence.  
In everything outside and within.   

Instead, only for outward show,  
And to **appease their own dogmas**,    
They perform charity, do rituals   
And visit temples.  
All as a conceit,   
To make their **uncertain future secure**,  
To have more, be safe,   
and avoid death & destruction.  
Their pursuit towards Me,   
Is only for **selfish ends**.  
They are just **takers**.   
From the world,   
And from Me!  

### Ever Thirsty & never content
Their lust can **never be appeased**.  
They are arrogant, and vain  
And **drunk with pride**.  
They run blindly **after what is evil**.  
The ends they work for are unclean,  
Guided by just one agenda -   
**self gratification of the senses.**  
And so, they are plagued by innumerable cares,  
From which **death alone can release them**.   

### The self talk of the ignorant 
Arjuna - Once in the demonic state, they become blind in their ignorance,   
their self talk is like the following -  

I wanted this and today I got it.  
I want that : I shall get it tomorrow.   
All these riches are now mine :   
Soon I shall have more.  
I have killed this enemy.   
I will kill all the rest.    
I am a ruler of men.    
I enjoy the things of this world.    
I am successful, strong and happy.   
Who is my equal?    
I am so wealthy and so nobly born.    
I will sacrifice to the Gods.    
I will give alms.    
I will make merry.
