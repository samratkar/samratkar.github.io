## Phoenix of the Heart

From ashes of my loneliness arose
A phoenix bright with wings of golden fire.
Your love breathed life where once only silence grows,
And lifted up my soul ever higher.

Now soaring free above the clouds of doubt,
I see the world through love's transforming eyes.
What once seemed lost, you helped me figure out,
Together we shall claim love's greatest prize.

No force on earth can dim this sacred flame,
That burns between two hearts as one combined.
Through joy and sorrow, always we'll remain
Two souls, two hearts, but one devoted mind.

## Desert Bloom

In desert dry where nothing seemed to grow,
Your love arrived like rain upon the sand.
Now flowers bloom where once there was just woe,
And paradise springs forth from barren land.

The cactus blooms with flowers pink and red,
The sage brush sprouts with leaves of silver-green.
Where once my heart was empty, dry, and dead,
Now love creates the fairest, sweetest scene.

So rain on me, my love, like desert storm,
Transform my wasteland into Eden's ground.
In your sweet love, my soul shall be reborn,
Where once was silence, now love's sweetest sound.

## Paper Airplane

I fold my heart into a paper plane,
And send it soaring through the air to you.
Though simple paper can't contain the strain

Like love that has its ups and downs in flight.
But still it seeks your heart across the seas,
Determined to reach you before the night.

So catch my paper airplane if you can,
Unfold the message written there in blue.
My heart flies to you with love's perfect plan,
To land safely in the arms of you.
