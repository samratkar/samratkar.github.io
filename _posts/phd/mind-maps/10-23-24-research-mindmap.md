# Research mind map

I am doing research on two topics relaed to AI safety -

1. AI alignment
2. Explainable AI

Both of these are of prime importance towards building safety critical AI systems. Be it private tutor for kids, or a pilot virtual assistant.

The [AI safety landscape ](https://excalidraw.com/#room=105e034dff386f4b99a0,RTYch2fYRiyqwrsYZtc4TQ)of all the areas under research is listed.

In that Explainable AI and AI alignment are the two topics of my research.
