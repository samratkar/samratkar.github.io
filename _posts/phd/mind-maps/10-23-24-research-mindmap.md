# Research mind map

I am doing research on two topics relaed to AI safety -

1. AI alignment
2. Explainable AI

Both of these are of prime importance towards building safety critical AI systems. Be it private tutor for kids, or a pilot virtual assistant.

The [AI safety landscape ](https://excalidraw.com/#json=GO8RWN28AbMItnrUdNz4s,HtspOk5X5Vd1YwaIZ_pymw)of all the areas under research is listed. 

In that Explainable AI and AI alignment are the two topics of my research.
