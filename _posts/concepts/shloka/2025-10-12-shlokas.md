## Saraswati Vandana
Reference : [https://shlokam.org/yaakundendu/](https://shlokam.org/yaakundendu/)

या कुन्देन्दुतुषारहारधवला या शुभ्रवस्त्रावृता
या वीणावरदण्डमण्डितकरा या श्वेतपद्मासना ।
या ब्रह्माच्युतशंकरप्रभृतिभिर्देवैः सदा पूजिता
सा मां पातु सरस्वति भगवती निःशेषजाड्यापहा ॥१॥

yā kundendutuṣārahāradhavalā yā śubhravastrāvṛtā
yā vīṇāvaradaṇḍamaṇḍitakarā yā śvetapadmāsanā .
yā brahmācyuta śaṃkaraprabhṛtibhirdevaiḥ sadā pūjitā
sā māṃ pātu sarasvati bhagavatī niḥśeṣajāḍyāpahā ..1..

Sarasvatī, Bhagavatī, is of fair complexion like the necklace which is as white as the jasmine, moon and snow, who is dressed in white clothes, whose hands adorn the divine vīņā, who is seated on a white lotus, who is always worshipped by Gods like Brahmā, Vişnu, Śankara. May she, who removes the darkness of ignorance, protect me!

I meditate upon (Lord Ganesa), the one who wears a white garment, who is all-pervasive, who has a (bright) complexion like the moon, who has four hands, who has a cheerful face, for the removal of all obstacles.
