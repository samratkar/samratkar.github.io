**Courtesy and Thanks** to sessions from [Vizuara.ai](https://vizuara.ai) that has helped me to understand the concepts discussed here below. 

## RNN

1. The memory is retained from the hidden layer. Previous state is passed to the current state.
2. Intestellar RNN 
3. RNN can be used as a language translator.
4. All burden of compression is in the last hidden state.
5. Video of Jay Allamar - what is passed to the decoder is the last hidden state.
6. This is a disadvantage of RNN. They have context limitation.
