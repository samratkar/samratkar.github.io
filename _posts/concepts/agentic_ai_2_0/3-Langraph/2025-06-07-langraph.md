3. Concepts covered
    - any model
    - any embedding
    - prompting 
    - chaining 
    - vector DB
    - RAG 
    - Multi Model RAG 
    - parser 
4. Agent 
   - Use langraph for agentic flow. 
   - Agent is an advanced AI assistant that can perform complex tasks by chaining together multiple models and tools.
   - Agent is an autonomous system containing 
     - Tools - action 
     - LLM 
5. Agentic Workflow (orchestrator creates the workflow)

1. Agentic AI - orchestration of multiple agents. 
2. Tools using langchain 
   1. standard
   2. custom
3. Langraph is a framework for building agentic flows in AI applications. It works as an orchestrator. Orchestrator is used to create agentic workflow.
