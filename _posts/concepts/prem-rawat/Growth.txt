When we talk of growth in terms of companies, we talk of lateral growth. This growth is about being bigger, heavier, and fatter by having new services and products. It is about increasing the market share. It is about creating something new that did not earlier exist.

But when we talk about growth in the context of own personal self, it is all about growing longitudinal growth which is directed vertically higher. In this case, growth is like being on a large sailboat. You start off on the deck and from there you can see a certain amount. If you climb up the rigging a little, you can see that much more. Then, you go a little  higher, you can see further still. If you keep climbing you will get to the crow's nest right at the top. From there you can see everything around the boat and for quite a long way.
Personal growth is not a process of creating new scenery. Rather it is a process in which you get to see things clearly, to see things as they are.

In life we have to leave one step behind in order to take the next. Success is built on our ability to evolve, to learn and to grow. To evolve, we must take along whats good, and leave behind what is not needed. Remember the story of ant of salt and sugar hill?
