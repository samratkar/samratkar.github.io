### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

**Question** : Describe the encoder and decoder networks in a VAE. What are their roles, and what do they output? What is the reparameterization trick, and why is it essential for training VAEs with gradient-based optimization? Illustrate with equations. Compare the training objective of VAEs with GANs. What does each optimize, and what are the implications for sample quality?
