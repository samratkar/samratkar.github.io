# The propensity to create the inner circle

We humans connect, form communities, teams and are known for our collective social cooperative abilities. This is not seen in other apes. We tend to form our own tribes, based on common platform. That helps us to do bigger things than we could ever been able to do, if we handle everything alone. Division of labor, collaboration and coordination is part of this large scale orchestration. But it is interesting to observe that there is an inherent design consideration.
