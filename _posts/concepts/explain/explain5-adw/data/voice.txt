The Voice in the Forest

Every evening, 12-year-old Ria would walk past the edge of the forest near her grandmother’s cottage. Everyone in the village said, “Don’t listen to the forest. It talks.” But Ria was curious.

One dusky evening, as the wind rustled the trees, she heard a voice whisper her name:
“Ria…”

She froze. “Who’s there?”

The voice replied, “Help me. I’ve been trapped for years.”

Terrified but drawn by something she couldn’t explain, she stepped into the woods. As she walked deeper, the voice grew clearer — young, frightened, familiar.

She reached a clearing and found… a girl. The girl looked exactly like her.

The other Ria said, “You’re the echo. I’m the real one. They took me, and made you.”

Before she could scream, the forest went quiet.

The next morning, Ria returned to her grandmother’s home, smiling calmly.

But if you looked closely, her eyes no longer sparkled the same way.
