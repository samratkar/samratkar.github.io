The Last Leaf

In a quiet town where winter came early, lived an old painter named Manu. His little studio overlooked a brick wall covered in ivy. As the cold winds blew, the leaves began to fall—one by one.

Next door lived a young artist, Asha, who had fallen ill. She stared at the ivy every day and whispered, “When the last leaf falls, I will go too.”

Manu heard her and said nothing. That night, during a storm, the final leaf fluttered and dropped. But the next morning, Asha saw one single leaf still clinging to the branch. Days passed, and the leaf never fell. Inspired, Asha regained hope and began to recover.

When she was well enough, she visited Manu—only to find that he had passed away. In his studio was a single painting: a perfect, lifelike leaf glued to the wall.

He had painted it that night in the storm, giving his last breath to give her hope.
