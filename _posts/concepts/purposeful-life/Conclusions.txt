1. You have to have a deep sense of purpose. Without that it leads to a sense of emptiness that leads to depression. Sense of purpose gives a sense of hope in future. If you dont have that hope, it creats a sense of void and leads to depression.
2. Once you have the purpose, you have to be sure that it is the right purpose. Running behind the purpose of fame, money, power do not lead to happiness, research shows. If yo have a wrong purpose then it is equally debilitating as leading a life with no purpose.
3. Professor speaks of being a camel before being a Lion. Before choosing one's own purpose, one has to really appreciate and have the perspective of what is essential and what is not - what is important and what is not. This sense of discernment is key to choosing the right purpose.
4. There is a good example given in the couse on difference between the right and the wrong purpose -
   This is the story of a athelete coach.
    > Wrong Purpose - How many champions I will produce. How successful and well sought after coach I will be. How much money will be paid.
    > Right Purpose - His role is the life of his team is to develop in them a fully functional human being. And he models all these things in himself that he wants his team to become - fully engaged, 100% effort, discipline, kind, resilient in life - and that is what purpose of his is here. And every day he gets a chance to interface with his team, he helps them grow as human beings! In the end of his life, how will he feel about what he has done in his life, as opposed to how many champions he has produced. One is empty, and one is full with Life.
5. YOU NEED TO GET THE PURPOSE. AND YOU NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE PURPOSE WAS RIGHT.
