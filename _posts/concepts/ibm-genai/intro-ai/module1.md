   **Capabilities:**
   **Forecasting:** Predicts future trends and events.
   **Clustering and classification:** Groups similar data points and classifies them into predefined categories.
   **Propensity model:** Assesses the likelihood of specific outcomes based on current data.
   **Decision trees:** Utilize a tree-like model of decisions to predict outcomes.
3. **Prescriptive AI**
   Prescriptive AI focuses on determining the optimal course of action by providing recommendations based on data analysis. It goes beyond prediction by suggesting actions that can help achieve desired outcomes.
   **Capabilities:**
   **Personalization:** Tailors recommendations and experiences to individual needs.
   **Optimization:** Identifies the most efficient ways to achieve goals.
   **Fraud prevention:** Detects and prevents fraudulent activities through analysis.
   **Next best action recommendation:** Provides actionable insights on the next steps to take.
4. **Generative/cognitive AI**
   Generative or cognitive AI is involved in producing various types of content, such as code, articles, images, and more. This type of AI mimics human creativity and cognitive processes to automate and assist in content creation.
   **Capabilities:**
   **Advises:** Offers expert advice and recommendations.
   **Creates:** Produces new content, such as text, images, and code.
   **Protects:** Enhances security measures through intelligent analysis.
   **Assists:** Provides assistance in various tasks, improving efficiency.
   **Automates:** Automates repetitive tasks to save time and resources.
5. **Reactive AI**
   Reactive AI systems are designed to respond to specific inputs with predetermined responses. They do not have memory or the ability to learn from past experiences, making them suitable for tasks that require immediate reactions.
   **Capabilities:**
   **Rule-based actions:** Executes specific actions based on predefined rules.
   **Instant responses:** Provides immediate responses to inputs.
   **Static data analysis:** Analyzes current data without considering past interactions.
6. **Limited memory AI:**
   Limited memory AI systems have the ability to use past experiences to inform current decisions. They can learn from historical data to improve their performance over time. This type of AI is commonly used in autonomous vehicles and recommendation systems.

### Traditional vs Generative AI

#### Traditional AI

```mermaid
graph LR 
Repository --> Analytics-Platform --> Application --> Repository
```

1. Repository - has the raw data from say customers.
2. Analytics platform - like say Watson studio that has models and you apply those models on the data to drive insights. Say customers who are about to churn.
3. Application layer - Here you take corrective actions based on the predictions and insights of the model. say you do something to avoid customers churn.
4. Feedback loop - allows you to automate the process. This is used to make the models better, based on the accuracy and precision metrics that we get of the model from the analytics platform. This is the MLOPs, where you continue to fine tune the model with this feedback loop.
