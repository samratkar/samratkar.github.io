### Toy solution using local databse 

in the code base for L1, we are doing the following - 
1. copy the invoices from a folder /invoice 
2. parse the pdfs invoices using pdf parser PdfReader from PyPDF
3. for every file, read the pdf, and pass to gemini and extract the following in json format - 
   1. client name 
   2. invoice amount
   3. product name 
4. Then these json are read and inserted into a db placed in the local. 
5. Then aggregation is done from the db. 
6. code - [https://github.com/samratkar/samratkar.github.io/blob/main/_posts/concepts/genai/notes-codes/a2a-box/l1/L1.ipynb](https://github.com/samratkar/samratkar.github.io/blob/main/_posts/concepts/genai/notes-codes/a2a-box/l1/L1.ipynb)
