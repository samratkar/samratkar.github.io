Brown is known for her work on shame, vulnerability, and leadership, and for her widely viewed 2010 TEDx talk.[2] She has written six number-one New York Times bestselling books and hosted two podcasts on Spotify.[3]\n",

        "Brown was born on November 18, 1965,[4] in San Antonio, Texas, where her parents, Charles Arthur Brown and Casandra Deanne Rogers,[4] had her baptized in the Episcopal Church. She is the eldest of four children.[5] Her family then moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[6]\n",

        "Research and teaching\n",

        "\n",
        "Public speaking\n",
        "Brown's TEDx talk from Houston in 2010, \"The Power of Vulnerability\", is one of the five most viewed TED talks. Its popularity shifted her work from relative obscurity in academia into the mainstream spotlight.[11][12][13][14] The talk \"summarizes a decade of Brown's research on shame, framing her weightiest discoveries in self-deprecating and personal terms.\"[14] Reggie Ugwu for The New York Times said that this event gave the world \"a new star of social psychology.\"[14] She went on to follow this popular TED talk with another titled \"Listening to Shame\" in 2012. In the second talk she talks about how her life has changed since the first talk and explains the connection between shame and vulnerability, building on the thesis of her first TED talk.[15]\n",
        "\n",
        "She also has a less well-known talk from 2010 given at TEDxKC titled \"The Price of Invulnerability.\" In it she explains that when numbing hard and difficult feelings, essentially feeling vulnerable, we also numb positive emotions, like joy.[16] This led to the creation of her filmed lecture, Brené Brown: The Call to Courage, which debuted on Netflix in 2019.[17] USA Today called it \"a mix of a motivational speech and stand-up comedy special.\"[17] Brown discusses how and why to choose courage over comfort, equating being brave to being vulnerable. According to her research, doing this opens people to love, joy, and belonging by allowing them to better know themselves and more deeply connect with other people.[18]\n",
