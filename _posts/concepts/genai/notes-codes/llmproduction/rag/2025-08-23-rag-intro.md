#### Chunking strategies
1. Fixed size chunking - never use for structured documents. use it for high speed of processing in streaming of sensor data. unstructured data like reddit, twitter etc. millions of web pages scapping. 
2. Semantic chunking - 
   1. define a level of organization - sentence, paragraph, section, chapter etc. it is better to have para level as semantically similar ones are together. 
   2. find the cosine similarity of the entire document for that do structure and keep the similar units in one chunk
   3. when you get a new chunk that is dissimilar, create a separate chunk.
3. Recursive chunking
   1. best of both worlds. 
   2. exploits the structure of documents and chunk size are consistent. 
   3. first make the chunking based on structure 
   4. make max chunk size as say 500. 
   5. keep recursively chunking - section -> paragraph -> sentence 
4. Structural chunking (structural chunking is done first. then fixed size is applied when one section is larger than max chunk size)
   1. Chunks 
      1. chunk a - letter to share holders.
      2. chunk b - introduction 
      3. chunk c - compoany overview 
      4. chunk d - financial stattements 
      5. chunk e - notes to financial statements 
      6. chunk f - conclusion and outlook 
   2. Issues - 
      1. how about when one section is huge? it will not fit to context window of LLM
      2. meta data - you can know which chunk belongs to which section. 
5. LLM chunking 
   1. Context drift in the conversations - fully unstructured data.
