1. llms are doing maths different from humans. they think differently. 
2. different parts of layers do different things
3. in each layer of the llm, different individual neurons of the layer are doing different things - 
   1. even within the same layer, each neuron has a different function; area of expertise
   2. some are needed for factual information, some for arithmetic.
   3. these roles for each neurons are not fixed. They learn and organize themselves on their own during training. They are adaptable. They are constantly learning on their own.
4. more we understand how llm works, we can know the strengths and weaknesses of the system.
5. understand how ai learns. study how these models learns and how they make decisions. AI is a mirror reflecting our own intelligence.
6. They have specific identifiable mechansims to handle different types of information
7. investigate all different training methods. how training change the roles
8. understand the language or creativity or maths how it changes are done. how these ai models think.
9. mechanistic understanding of how these models work. - actual circuitry of the models.
10. bills zed all - going on in the neurons - individual neuron level
11. circuts in these models - transparent ai 
12. hugg it all - attention mechanism.
