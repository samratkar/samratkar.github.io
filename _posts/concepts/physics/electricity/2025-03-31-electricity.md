## Definition 1 of Coulomb
The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb which is denoted by the letter C. 


One coulomb is that **quantity** of electric charge which **exerts** a **force** of $9 \times 10^9$ Newtons, on an **equal charge** placed at a distance of **1 metre** from it.

## Definition 2 of Coulomb
Charge of 1 electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C.
Therefore 1 C of charge is equal to the charge of $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

## Electric Potential

Electric potential is defined as the **work done** in bringing a **unit positive charge** from **infinity** to that point in the electric field.
Electric potential is a **scalar quantity** and is denoted by the letter **V**.
Electric potential is measured in **volts** (V).

>**Note** that Potential is always measured with respect to **work done**. This is something like a hidden capability that a student earns by doing work. This work has two components - **Force and Distance**. Something like, just sincere studies on one day is not enough to crack IISc. Bikas needs to study hard every day for the entire 3 years to be able to crack IISc. So, unlike charge, potential is not just Force. Rather it is **$Force \times Distance = Work$**
