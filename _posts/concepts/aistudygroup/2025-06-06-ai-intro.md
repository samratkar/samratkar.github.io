## 1. Software engineering Vs Machine Learning 
- algorithm - steps to be followed - known logic 
- Machine Learning - recognizing patterns and making decisions based on data. 

## 2. ML Vs Deep Learning. 
- ML - machine learning 
  - Linear regression - regression
  - Decision trees - classification
  - K-Nearest Neighbors - classification
  - Random Forest - classification
  - Support Vector Machines - classification
  - Naive Bayes - classification
  - Ensemble methods - regression and classification
- Evaluation of the model 
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
- A data scientist should know about the strenghts and weaknesses of each algorithm, and when to use them. An SME would help the data scientist to choose the right algorithm for the problem at hand.
- **feature engineering** - process of selecting, modifying, or creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- **Deep Learning - deep neural networks**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - image data
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - sequential data
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks - sequential data
  - Transformers - sequential data
- ML Ops 
- DL - 
- Aim 
  - Get data 
  - Divide the data into training and testing set 
    - 80% - training set 
    - 20% - testing set
