# Introduction

**T**he Panchatantra is an ancient collection of animal fables told in 300 BCE by Vishnu Sharma. It teaches us life lessons through engaging animal fables. Panchatantra has stories divided into 5 tantras or chapters. Each of these tantras has a main thread story which expands on the main theme of the tantra by including many sub-stories.

# A Project

Long long ago, in the southern part of India, there was a city known as Mahilaaropyam. There lived a king named Amarashakti. He was regarded as Kalpavirksha by all seekers. He was an expert in all fine arts. His sons named Bahusakti, Ugrasakti, Anantasakti, were extremely dim witted. 

Once looking at his sons who did not have any knowledge of shashtras, he called the ministers and said, how to make them learned. 

1. Grammar - Vyakarana - 12 years
2. Ethics - Dharma Sastra - by Manu and others.
3. Economics - Arthasastra - by Chanakya
4. Love making - Kamasastra - by Vatsayana

Long way to go! 

How to condense it, and remove the unimportant frills and reject the insignificant, accepting the significant part, and communicate effectively.

One minster recommended to reach out to **Vishnusharma** who was well versed in all Shashtras and that he can help in this project. 

**King** - The king called Vishnusharma and said - "O Bhagawan! Grant me a favor by doing whatever it takes to make these sons experts in Arthasastra quickly. I shall give you 100 villages"

**Vishusharma** - I shall not sell knowledge. Even for 100 villages. But I shall make your sons expert in Shashtras in 6 months. Being already 80 years old, I shall do wonder with my words. 

The King was happy and gave away his sons to Vishnusharma, who took them along. He wrote 5 Tantras -
