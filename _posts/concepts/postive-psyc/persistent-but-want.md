1. We not always need to choose one side - right or wrong. 
2. Loving without attachment to a person, but being attached to the human value is that what inspires. 
3. We can continue to Love, continue to want, even when the other person does not reciprocates. And still not be attached to the outcome. But showing up daily. No matter what. 
4. Black or white. Rather we can have a poise and be there where we are, and expand.
5. More specifically, one can continue to love, continue to want, even when the other person does not reciprocate. One can show up and be persistent, for persistence sake, because that value inspires me. Without an attachment to a hidden agenda. But still want! And you never know, things might change!
