# ðŸŒ¹ Pablo Neruda: Poems Celebrating the Physical Beauty of His Muses

## ðŸ“œ Body of a Woman, White Hills, White Thighs


> **Body of a woman, white hills, white thighs,**  
> you look like a world, lying in surrender.  
> My rough peasant's body digs in you  
> and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth.  
>
> I was alone like a tunnel. The birds fled from me,  
> and night swamped me with its crushing invasion.  
> To survive myself I forged you like a weapon,  
> like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling.  
>
> But the hour of vengeance falls, and I love you.  
> Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk.  
> Oh the goblets of the breast! Oh the eyes of absence!  
> Oh the roses of the pubis! Oh your voice slow and sad!  
>
> Body of my woman, I will persist in your grace.  
> My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road!  
> Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows  
> and weariness follows, and the infinite ache.

## ðŸŒº Ode to a Naked Beauty


> **With chaste heart, with eyes  
> pure of sin,  
> I beheld  
> the perfect nakedness**  
> of your body.  
> Your skin, soft and luminous,  
> mirrors the world.  
>
> Your breasts also,  
> of equal fullness, overflowing  
> with the living light  
> and, yes,  
> winged  
> your eyelids of silken corn  
> that disclose  
> or enclose  
> the deep twin landscapes of your eyes.  
>
> It is not the light of a lamp  
> or the blue flame of a torch  
> that caresses your body;  
> it is a clarity  
> whiter than light,  
> whiter than the stars,  
> whiter than snow,  
> which renders the world in shadow  
> when you appear naked.  
>
> Naked you are as simple as one of your hands,  
> smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round.  
> Naked you are blue as the night in Cuba,  
> with stars as your hair and fire as your eyes.  
>
> Naked you are thin as a naked grain of wheat,  
> Naked you are a wave,  
> resounding in every corner of the world.  
> Naked you are the clarity itself:  
> you are the cup  
> from which life flows.
