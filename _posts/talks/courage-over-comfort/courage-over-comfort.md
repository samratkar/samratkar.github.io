# Courage over comfort

1. Brothers and Sisters of DAS. My heart is filled with unfathomable joy and gratitude to be standing here and sharing with you a little story of a little lad from 1970s. 

The love for Psychology started with a subject in my school known as **Moral Science - Girl Boy Attraction**. And Love for Computer Science started when I was successfully able to **program a text based cricket game** using BASIC language in my school using the age old intel 8086 black and white computers with big fat screens and floppy drives.

I am 46 yrs old today. The journey for last 36 years has been pretty rewarding, joyous and fulfilling. In this ever rejuvenating journey I have met, known, and entered into the **sanctified hallows** of the amazing minds of great masters. There presence in my life has guided me through several experiments, experiences, and learning. Today, I am very excited to share a glimpse of of my 2nd love - Psychology.

Among these great masters, I am very excited to share with you a glimpse of work of one of those - **Brene Brown**.

She has done a decade long research on **Vulnerability, Shame, Empathy, and Courage**. Of all her seminal works, I will give you an overview of her book **"Dare to Lead".**

6. In the onslaught of criticism, uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure, being able to lean in, be vulnerable and have tough conversations, not giving into violence is what is the subject of today's talk. How we can stop beheading our own self, thinking it to be our enemy?
7. get into the mapping of armored leadership and daring leadership.
8. End the talk with the quote of the Roosevelt speech - 
> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually **in the arena**, whose face is **marred by dust and sweat and blood;** who **strives valiantly**; **who errs, who comes short again and again** â€¦ who at the best knows in the end the **triumph of high achievement**, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least **fails while daring greatly**. - *Theodore Roosevelt*
