## Agni 

Agni in the Veda is not merely the fire o the Vedic Altar or even the deity behind the physical fire. The ordinary fire is a source of heat and light which prompted the Vedic sages to symbolise the edity of spiritual Light and spiritual Force by the word  Agni. 
**The physical flame gives light all through the night amidst darkness and it impels human beings to study or work otherwise**
Similarly, the Divine Power of Agni is residing in every human being who is full of ignorance and in conscience pushing him or her towards progress. 
Agni is that Divine Power of will united with wisdom, denoted by the word "Kratu'. 

It is not desire; but it embraces desire and surpasses and surpasses it. In the Veda Agni is essentially Knowledge, or Light taking the form of force. Agni is the mental force, will power, necessary for all action. It is Agni who makes the Divine knowledge of the Supreme Sun accessible to human beings. 

He has many other functions, particularly the force of concentration, tapas, austerity. he is the force of combustion in the cosmos and also the fire in the stomach "jatharagni" who digests the food in man. 

In the Rig Veda Agni is said to reside hidden in teh cave of the heart, Guha. The ordinary human being in his outward activities is unaware of the presence of Agni. Still Agni prompts him/her on the journey.
