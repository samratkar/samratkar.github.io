# Courage over comfort

1. Good Morning everybody. My DAS family. Like all family get together, it is a pleasure standing in that presence of warm belonging, and sharing our heart's echos. Most of my friends and family already know, I have a deep, overwhelming, and long lasting love affair with **Computer Science** and **Psychology**. The journey started when I was a child, of about 8-10 years. My **parents did not used to stay with me**. I used to live with my elder brother and sister in a small town in Bihar known as Bhagalpur.

The love for Psychology started with a subject in my school known as **Moral Science - Girl Boy Attraction**. And Love for Computer Science started when I was successfully able to **program a text based cricket game** using BASIC language in my school using the age old intel 8086 black and white computers with big fat screens and floppy drives.

I am 46 yrs old today. The journey for last 36 years has been pretty rewarding, joyous and fulfilling. In this ever rejuvenating journey I have met, known, and entered into the **sanctified hallows** of the amazing minds of great masters. I have written about 200 poems, and 100s of prose. I have published one book of poems.  
3. These two glaring passions of my life has taken me through roller coaster ride through myriad of experiments, experiences, and learning. Today, I am very excited to to share a glimpse of my 2nd love - Psychology.  
4. In my life of about a decade and a half years of experimenting with leadership, it has always helped me standing on the shoulders of giants - looking for answers in the seminal works on organizational psychology and leadership. Works of Erich Fromm, Victor Frankl, Czikzentmihalyi, Peter Drucker, Daniel Pink, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Brene Brown has greatly helped me to find answers, look within me, know myself better, and craft my character and leadership style. Today, I am going to talk about the work of Brene Brown, especially her book Dare to Lead.
5. Story of Luke and Yoda
6. In the onslaught of criticism, uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure, being able to lean in, be vulnerable and have tough conversations, not giving into violence is what is the subject of today's talk. How we can stop beheading our own self, thinking it to be our enemy?
7. get into the mapping of armored leadership and daring leadership.
8. very highly touch over my own history
9.  end the talk with the quote of the Roosevelt speech
