# Courage over comfort

1. In my life of about a decade and a half years of experimenting with leadership, it has always helped me standing on the shoulders of giants - looking for answers in the seminal works on organizational psychology and leadership. Works of Erich Fromm, Victor Frankl, Czikzentmihalyi, Peter Drucker, Daniel Pink, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Brene Brown has greatly helped me to find answers, look within me, know myself better, and craft my character and leadership style. Today, I am going to talk about the work of Brene Brown, especially her book Dare to Lead.
2. Story of Luke and Yoda
3. In the onslaught of criticism, uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure, being able to lean in, be vulnerable and have tough conversations, not giving into violence is what is the subject of today's talk. How we can stop beheading our own self, thinking it to be our enemy?
4. get into the mapping of armored leadership and daring leadership.
5. very highly touch over my own history
6. end the talk with the quote of the Roosevelt speech
