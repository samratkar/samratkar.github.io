1. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for your time.
2. In my decade long courtship with leadership today I would like to share with you my findings on how to build innovating teams through vulnerability.
3. I have been inspired by the work of Brene Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston. She has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy.
4. In her book Dare to Lead, she writes about how vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
5. She says that vulnerability is not weakness, it is our most accurate measure of courage.
6. In my experience, I have found that the most innovative teams are those that are able to be vulnerable with each other.
7. When we are vulnerable, we are able to share our fears, our doubts, our insecurities, and our failures.
8. When we are able to do this, we create a safe space for others to do the same.
9. This is how we build trust, and trust is the foundation of any successful team.
10. When we trust each other, we are able to take risks, to experiment, to fail, and to learn.
11. This is how we innovate, this is how we create something new, something better, something that has never been done before.
12. So I encourage you to be vulnerable with each other, to share your fears, your doubts, your insecurities, and your failures.
