# Book - Hear yourself by Prem Rawat.

1. No one can give you **peace**. It is something you have to uncover for **yourself**, by your own **efforts**.
2. In this journey you come to understand **yourself in new ways**.
3. Wisdom is not a product of schooling, but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.
4. Something I feel we should celebrate much more in our life : our incredible human spirit.
