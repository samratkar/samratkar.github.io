## When the blessing returns  


**When the blessing returns**  

When the stream seems dry,  
The farmer toils but does not sigh.  
He sees around the land, river and lakes,  
From there he draws in water.  
Skillfully tending burrows and channels,  
He knows the secret of the soil.  
He knows the mystery of the rain.  
He runs, chases, and catches the clouds.  
But does not wait for the sky to open,  
He looks out for the hidden springs.  
And the remote wells,  
He knows the art of patience.  
Persevering and persisting, gritfully,   
He toils and works, day and night,  
He is marred with sweat, dust and blood.  
But he discovers, he builds, he creates, he learns.  
Bringing life to the land barren,  
Pulling in water from unknown lands!  

**The transformation**  

The stream transformed into a gushing river.  
The land, once dry, now fertile and green,  
The blessing returned.  
Maybe the farmer is no more.  
But his legacy lives.   
The land is alive, the river flows,  
The blessing returns, again and again.  

**The legacy**  

What was important was not the love was not lost,  
No love was wasted.  
The drying stream did rejuvenate,  
Only that the wait was vast,  
But it was all worth it.  
For it is the privilege of being human,  
To wait, to toil, to learn,  
And leave behind a legacy,  
A legacy of love, of life, of hope.  
When the blessing returns.
