## ❤️ Sonnet XVII
*From “100 Love Sonnets”*

> I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,  
> or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:  
> I love you as one loves certain obscure things,  
> secretly, between the shadow and the soul.  
>
> I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries  
> the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself,  
> and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose  
> from the earth lives dimly in my body.  
>
> I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.  
> I love you directly without problems or pride:  
> I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,  
> except in this form in which I am not nor are you,  
> so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,  
> so close that your eyes close with my dreams.

## 💔 Tonight I Can Write the Saddest Lines

> Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  
> Write, for example, “The night is starry  
> and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.”  
>
> The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.  
>
> Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  
> I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.  
>
> Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.  
> I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.  
>
> She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.  
> How could one not have loved her great still eyes?  
>
> Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer,  
> and these the last verses that I write for her.

## 🌅 Ode to Hope

> Hope,  
> you are the youngest sister  
> of the sky,  
> green branch,  
> pearl of the sea,  
> infinite  
> tenderness.  
>
> Sometimes  
> you dress yourself  
> in silence  
> like a stone  
> and then  
> your pure form  
> spreads  
> sound  
> through the trees  
> like a wing.  
>
> Let everything tremble  
> as you pass by  
> and the earth grow green again  
> under your steps.

## 🔥 If You Forget Me

> I want you to know  
> one thing.  
>
> You know how this is:  
> if I look  
> at the crystal moon, at the red branch  
> of the slow autumn at my window,  
> if I touch  
> near the fire  
> the impalpable ash  
> or the wrinkled body of the log,  
> everything carries me to you.  
>
> If little by little you stop loving me  
> I shall stop loving you little by little.  
>
> But  
> if each day,  
> each hour,  
> you feel that you are destined for me  
> with implacable sweetness,  
> if each day a flower  
> climbs up to your lips to seek me,  
> ah my love, ah my own,  
> in me all that fire is repeated,  
> in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,  
> my love feeds on your love, beloved,  
> and as long as you live it will be in your arms  
> without leaving mine.

## 💫 I Do Not Love You Except Because I Love You

> I do not love you except because I love you;  
> I go from loving to not loving you,  
> From waiting to not waiting for you  
> My heart moves from cold to fire.  
>
> I love you only because it’s you the one I love;  
> I hate you deeply, and hating you  
> Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you  
> Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.
