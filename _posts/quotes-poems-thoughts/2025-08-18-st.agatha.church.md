## Interesting snippets 

i left the cathedral in tears, completely overwhelmed by the intricacy of the sculptures and humbled by the intense devotion to one’s faith it must have taken for those artists to painstakingly create something so beautiful!

The statues of Jesus and Mary and the saints were so lifelike and so ethereal at the same time, and it was the closest I had ever felt to heaven.

I still do not have the words for that feeling, except that it made me want to be better, kinder, and more faithful to the divine and to the secular, too
I suppose he has made peace with the fact that people come and go (Italians are lovely that way—they enjoy moments without fearing their impermanence, they offer affection simply because bodies are meant to touch, and they drink to taste, not to get drunk—there is a wonderful lightness about all of it). He smiled and kissed both of my cheeks.

Art is holy
I hope that you will see art that changes you, and I hope that you will carry it in your pocket for the rest of your life

I hope that you will speak what’s in your heart until there is nothing left to be said, and I hope that you will have something more to say sometime soon.

In short, life is beautiful and holiness is everywhere—it is carved into sculptures and painted onto ceilings and pressed into the warm hand of a stranger who teaches you that even across languages, the heart understands.
