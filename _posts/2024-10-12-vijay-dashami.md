A life ticking strong. 
An inspiration! 
An example of being an agency.
To fight over mediocrity, status quo, 
Never ending struggles, neck breaking challenges, 
Ruthless unpredictable changes.
On the face of all the tribulations,
To stand tall, to stand strong,
To stand as a victor,
To stand as a winner!

Sprouting the seed of that ingenuity of being a human,
Nurturing it with the finest expressions, actions, and intent,
to make it a tree of life, a tree of inspiration,
a tree of example, a tree of agency!

All that is cold, dark, and evil,
All that is mediocre, status quo, and mundane,
All that is inaction, cowardice, and fear,
All that is inhuman, unjust, and unfair,
May all that be vanquished,
Through the life's force, 
The focus of attention, discipline, intent and purpose. 
May every moment be a moment of victory,
Every day be a day of triumph! 

Celebrating the essence of life,
Endlessly aligned with the the most auspicious, 
The most powerful, the most victorious,
Bowing down to her feet, in love and surrender. 

Happy Vijaya Dashami!
