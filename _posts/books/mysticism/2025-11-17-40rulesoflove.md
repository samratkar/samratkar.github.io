![](/assets/bookworm/40rulesoflove.jpg)

---

## Rule 1 : Seeing God 
How we see God   
is a direct reflection of   
how we see ourselves.  
If God brings to mind  
Mostly fear and blame,  
It means there is too much  
fear and blame   
welled inside us.  
If we see God  
As full of love and compassion  
So are we.  

---

## Rule 2 : Know! through heart
The path to the Truth  
Is the labour of the heart,  
Not of the head.  
Make your heart your primary guide.  
Not your mind.  
Meet, challenge,   
And ultimately prevail  
Over your nafs with your heart,  
Knowing yourself will   
Lead you to the knowledge of God.  

---

## Rule 3 : Immanence of God.
You can study God  
Through everything and everyone  
In the universe,  
Because God is not confined  
in a mosque, synagogue, or church.  
But if you are still  
In need of knowing where exactly  
His abode is,  
There is only one place  
To look for Him :   
In the heart of a true lover.  

---

## Rule 4 : Intellect and Love 
Intellect and love   
Are made of different materials.  
Intellect ties people in knots  
And risks nothing,  
But love dissolves all tangles  
And risks everything.  
Intellect is always cautious and advises,  
"Beware too much ecstasy!"  
Whereas love says,  
"Oh, never mind! Take the plunge!"  
Intellect does not easily break down,  
Whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble.  
But treasures are hidden among ruins.  
A broken heart hides treasures.  

---

## Rule 5 : Beyond words
Most of the problems of the world,  
Stem from linguistic mistakes  
And simple misunderstandings.  
Don’t ever take words at face value.  
When you step into the zone of love,  
Language as we know it  
Becomes obsolete.  
That which cannot be put into words  
Can only be gasped through silence.  

---

## Rule 6 : Truly seeing self & God
Loneliness and solitude   
Are two different things.  
When you are lonely,  
It is easy to delude yourself  
Into believing that   
You are on the right path.  
Solitude is better for us,  
as it means being   
alone without feeling lonely.  
But eventually it is best  
To find a person,  
The person who   
Will be your mirror.  
Remember, only in   
Another person’s heart can you  
Truly see yourself and  
The presence of God within you!  

---

## Rule 7 : Gratitude always 
Whatever happens in your life,  
No matter how troubling things might seem,  
Do not enter the neighborhood of despair.  
Even when all doors remain closed,  
God will open up  
A new path only for you.   
Be thankful!  
It is easy to be thankful  
When all is well.  
A Sufi is thankful  
Not only for what he has been given  
But also for all that he has been denied.  

---

## Rule 8 : Patience eternal
Patience does not mean to passively endure.  
It means to be farsighted enough  
To trust the end result of a process.  
What does patience mean?  
It means to look at the thorn  
And see the rose,  
To look at the night,  
And see the dawn.   
Impatience means   
To be shortsighted  
As to not be able to see the outcome.  
The lovers of God  
NNever run out of patience,  
For they know  
That time is needed for   
Crescent moon to become full.

## Rule 9 : Different levels 
Each and reader comprehends the Holy Quran  
On a different level in tandem   
With the depth of his understanding.  
There are four levels of insight.  
The first level is the outer meaning  
And it is the one   
That the majority of the people are content with.  
Next is the Batins - the inner level.  
Third, there is the inner of the inner.  
And the fourth level  
Is so deep   
It cannot be put  
Into words and   
Is therefore bound to remain indescribable  

---

## Rule 10 : The journey within
East, west, south or north,  
Makes little difference.  
No matter what your destination,  
Just be sure to make  
Every journey a journey within.  
If you travel within,  
You will travel the whole wide world  
And Beyond.  

---

## Rule 11 : Perfection in pain
The midwife knows that when  
There is no pain,  
The way for the baby   
Cannot be opened   
And the mother cannot give birth.  
Likewise for a new self to be born,   
Hardship is necessary.  
Just as clay needs to go through  
Intense heat to become strong.  
Love can only be   
Perfected in pain.  

---

## Rule 12 : The quest of change 
The quest for Love changes us.  
There is no seeker among those,  
Who search for Love   
who has not matured on the way.  
The moment you start seeking for Love,  
YOu start to change within and without.  

---

## Rule 13 : Fake Gurus 
There are more fake gurus and false teachers,  
In this world, than the number of stars   
In the visible universe.  
Don't confuse power-driven,  
self-centered people   
With true mentors.  
A genuine spiritual master  
Will not direct your attention  
To himself or herself  
And will not expect absolute obedience  
Or utter admiration from you,  
But instead will help you  
To appreciate and admire your inner self.  
True mentors are as transparent as glass.  
They let the light of God pass through them.  

---

## Rule 14 : Embracing change
Try not to resist the changes  
That come your way.  
Instead let life live through you.  
And do not worry  
That your life is turning upside down.  
How do you know   
That the side you are used to  
Is better than the one to come?  

---

## Rule 15 : The divine in everyone
God is busy with completion of your work,  
Both outwardly and inwardly.  
He is fully occupied with you.  
Every human being  is a work in progress  
That is slowly but inexorably  
moving toward perfection.   
We are each an unfinished work of art  
Both waiting and striving to be completed.  
God deals with each of us separately  
because humanity is a fine art  
Of skilled penmanship  
Where every singled dot  
Is equally important for the entire picture.   

---

## Rule 16 : The difficulty of loving humans
It is easy to love a perfect God,  
Unblemished and infallible that He is.  
What is far more difficult   
Is to love fellow human beings  
With all their imperfections and defects.  
Remember, one can only know what one is capable of loving.  
There is no wisdom without love.  
Unless we learn to love God's creation,  
We can neither truly love nor truly know God.  

---

## Rule 17 : The real filth
Real filth is the one inside.   
The rest simply washes off.  
There is only one type of dirt  
That cannot be cleansed with pure waters,  
And that is stain of hatred,  
And bigotry contaminating the soul.  
You can purify your body  
Through abstinence and fasting,  
But only love will   
Purify your heart.
