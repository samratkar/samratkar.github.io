## The Forty Rules of Love

![](/assets/bookworm/40rulesoflove.jpg)

---

## Rule 1 : Seeing God 
How we see God   
is a direct reflection of   
how we see ourselves.  
If God brings to mind  
Mostly fear and blame,  
It means there is too much  
fear and blame   
welled inside us.  
If we see God  
As full of love and compassion  
So are we.  

---

## Rule 2 : Know! through heart
The path to the Truth  
Is the labour of the heart,  
Not of the head.  
Make your heart your primary guide.  
Not your mind.  
Meet, challenge,   
And ultimately prevail  
Over your nafs with your heart,  
Knowing yourself will   
Lead you to the knowledge of God.  

---

## Rule 3 : Immanence of God.
You can study God  
Through everything and everyone  
In the universe,  
Because God is not confined  
in a mosque, synagogue, or church.  
But if you are still  
In need of knowing where exactly  
His abode is,  
There is only one place  
To look for Him :   
In the heart of a true lover.  

---

## Rule 4 : Intellect and Love 
Intellect and love   
Are made of different materials.  
Intellect ties people in knots  
And risks nothing,  
But love dissolves all tangles  
And risks everything.  
Intellect is always cautious and advises,  
"Beware too much ecstasy!"  
Whereas love says,  
"Oh, never mind! Take the plunge!"  
Intellect does not easily break down,  
Whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble.  
But treasures are hidden among ruins.  
A broken heart hides treasures.  

---

## Rule 5 : Beyond words
Most of the problems of the world,  
Stem from linguistic mistakes  
And simple misunderstandings.  
Don’t ever take words at face value.  
When you step into the zone of love,  
Language as we know it  
Becomes obsolete.  
That which cannot be put into words  
Can only be gasped through silence.  

---

## Rule 6 : Truly seeing self & God
Loneliness and solitude   
Are two different things.  
When you are lonely,  
It is easy to delude yourself  
Into believing that   
You are on the right path.  
Solitude is better for us,  
as it means being   
alone without feeling lonely.  
But eventually it is best  
To find a person,  
The person who   
Will be your mirror.  
Remember, only in   
Another person’s heart can you  
Truly see yourself and  
The presence of God within you!  

---

## Rule 7 : Gratitude always 
Whatever happens in your life,  
No matter how troubling things might seem,  
Do not enter the neighborhood of despair.  
Even when all doors remain closed,  
God will open up  
A new path only for you.   
Be thankful!  
It is easy to be thankful  
When all is well.  
A Sufi is thankful  
Not only for what he has been given  
But also for all that he has been denied.  

---

## Rule 8 : Patience eternal
Patience does not mean to passively endure.  
It means to be farsighted enough  
To trust the end result of a process.  
What does patience mean?  
It means to look at the thorn  
And see the rose,  
To look at the night,  
And see the dawn.   
Impatience means   
To be shortsighted  
As to not be able to see the outcome.  
The lovers of God  
NNever run out of patience,  
For they know  
That time is needed for   
Crescent moon to become full.   

---

## Rule 9 : Different levels 
Each and reader comprehends the Holy Quran  
On a different level in tandem   
With the depth of his understanding.  
There are four levels of insight.  
The first level is the outer meaning  
And it is the one   
That the majority of the people are content with.  
Next is the Batins - the inner level.  
Third, there is the inner of the inner.  
And the fourth level  
Is so deep   
It cannot be put  
Into words and   
Is therefore bound to remain indescribable  

---

## Rule 10 : The journey within
East, west, south or north,  
Makes little difference.  
No matter what your destination,  
Just be sure to make  
Every journey a journey within.  
If you travel within,  
You will travel the whole wide world  
And Beyond.  

---

## Rule 11 : Perfection in pain
The midwife knows that when  
There is no pain,  
The way for the baby   
Cannot be opened   
And the mother cannot give birth.  
Likewise for a new self to be born,   
Hardship is necessary.  
Just as clay needs to go through  
Intense heat to become strong.  
Love can only be   
Perfected in pain.  

---

## Rule 12 : The quest of change 
The quest for Love changes us.  
There is no seeker among those,  
Who search for Love   
who has not matured on the way.  
The moment you start seeking for Love,  
YOu start to change within and without.  

---

## Rule 13 : Fake Gurus 
There are more fake gurus and false teachers,  
In this world, than the number of stars   
In the visible universe.  
Don't confuse power-driven,  
self-centered people   
With true mentors.  
A genuine spiritual master  
Will not direct your attention  
To himself or herself  
And will not expect absolute obedience  
Or utter admiration from you,  
But instead will help you  
To appreciate and admire your inner self.  
True mentors are as transparent as glass.  
They let the light of God pass through them.  

---

## Rule 14 : Embracing change
Try not to resist the changes  
That come your way.  
Instead let life live through you.  
And do not worry  
That your life is turning upside down.  
How do you know   
That the side you are used to  
Is better than the one to come?  

---

## Rule 15 : The divine in everyone
God is busy with completion of your work,  
Both outwardly and inwardly.  
He is fully occupied with you.  
Every human being  is a work in progress  
That is slowly but inexorably  
moving toward perfection.   
We are each an unfinished work of art  
Both waiting and striving to be completed.  
God deals with each of us separately  
because humanity is a fine art  
Of skilled penmanship  
Where every singled dot  
Is equally important for the entire picture.   

---

## Rule 16 : The difficulty of loving humans
It is easy to love a perfect God,  
Unblemished and infallible that He is.  
What is far more difficult   
Is to love fellow human beings  
With all their imperfections and defects.  
Remember, one can only know what one is capable of loving.  
There is no wisdom without love.  
Unless we learn to love God's creation,  
We can neither truly love nor truly know God.  

---

## Rule 17 : The real filth
Real filth is the one inside.   
The rest simply washes off.  
There is only one type of dirt  
That cannot be cleansed with pure waters,  
And that is stain of hatred,  
And bigotry contaminating the soul.  
You can purify your body  
Through abstinence and fasting,  
But only love will   
Purify your heart.   

---

## Rule 18 : The Singularity
The whole universe is contained
Within a single human being - you. 
Everything that you see around,
including the things you might not be fond of
And even the people you despise or abhor,
Is present within you in varying degrees. 
Therefore do not look for Sheitan
Outside yourself either. 
The devil is not an extraordinary force 
That attacks from without. 
It is an ordinary voice within.
If you get to know yourself fully, 
Facing the honesty and hardness
Both your dark and bring sides,
You will arrive at 
A supreme form of consciousness.
When a person knows himself or herself,
he or she knows God.

---

## Rule 19 : We are all one 
If you want to change 
the way others treat you,
You should first change 
the way you treat yourself.
Unless you learn to love yourself,
Fully and sincerely, 
There is no way you can be loved.
Once you achieve that stage,
However, be thankful 
For every thorn 
that other might throw at you.
It is a sign that you will soon
be showered in roses. 
How can you blame others
For disrespecting you
When you think of yourself
As unworthy of respect?

---

## Rule 20 : Be the flow
Fret not where the road will take you.
Instead concentrate on the first step.
That's the hardest part
And that's what you are responsible for.
Once you take that step 
Let everything do what it naturally does.
And rest will follow. 
Do not go with the flow
Be the flow. 

---

## Rule 21 : Respecting differences
We are all created in His image,
And yet we were each created 
different and unique. 
No two people are alike.
No two hearts beat to the same rhythm.
If God had wanted everyone to be the same,
He would have made it so.
Therefore, disrespecting differences
And imposing your thoughts on others,
Is tantamount to disrespecting God's holy scheme.

---

## Rule 22 : The Inner Realm
When a true lover of God
Goes into a tavern,
The tavern becomes his 
chamber of prayer,
But when a wine bibber goes
Into the same chamber,
It becomes his tavern. 

In everything we do,
It is our hearts 
that make the difference,
Not our outer appearences.

Sufis do not judge
Other people on how they look
Or who they are.

When a Sufi stares at someone,
He keeps both eyes closed
And instead opens a third eye - 
The eye that sees the inner realm. 

---

## Rule 23 : The temporary loan
Life is a temporary loan,
And this world is nothing
But a sketchy imitation of Reality.

Only children would mistake
A toy for the real thing.

And yet human beings 
Either become infatuated with the toy
Or Disrespectfully break it
And throw it aside.

In this life stay away from 
all kind sof extremities,
For they will destroy 
your inner balance. 

---

## Rule 24 : The human divinity
The human being has a unique place
Among God's creations.
Each and every one of us without exception
Is designed to be God's delegate on Earth.

As yourself, just how often 
do you behave like a delegate.
If you ever do so?
Remember, it falls upon each of us
To discover the divine sprit 
Inside and live by it.

---

## Rule 25 : Hell and heaven
Hell is in the here and now.
So, is heaven.
Quit worrying about hell
Or dreaming about heaven,
As they are both
Present inside this very moment.

Every time we fall in love,
We ascend to heaven.
Every time we hate, 
Envy, or fight someone,
We tumble straight into 
The fires of hell.

---

## Rule 26 : The One Being
The universe is one being.
Everything and everyone
Is interconnected 
Through an invisible web of stories.

Whether we are aware of it or not, 
We are all in a silent conversation.
Do no harm. 
Practice compassion. 
And do not gossip behind anyone's back - 
Not even a seemingly innocent remark!
The words that come out of our mouths
Do not vanish 
But are perpetually stored in
Infinite space,
And they will come back to us
In due time.
One man's pain will hurt us all.
One man's joy will make everyone simle.

---

## Rule 27 : The echoes of snowy mountain
This world is like 
A snowy mountain,
That echoes your voice.

Whatever you speak, 
Good or evil,
Will somehow come back to you.

Therefore, if there is someone 
Who harbors ill thoughts about you,
Saying similarly bad things about him
Will only make matters worse.
You will be locked in a vicious circle
Of malevolent energy.

Instead of forty days and nights
Say and think nice things about that person.
Everything will be different
At the end of the forty days,
Because you will be different inside.

---


## Rule 28 : Time - The endless spiral within
The past is an interpretation. 
The future is an illusion.
The world does not move through time
As if it were a straight line,
Proceeding from past to the future.
Instead time moves 
Through and within us,
In endless spirals.

Eternity does not mean infinite time,
But simply timelessness.

If you want to experience 
Eternal illumination,
Put the past and the future 
Out of your mind
And remain within
The present moment.

---

## Rule 29 : The Destiny of 40 levels
Destiny does not mean that
Your life has been strictly predetermined.
Therefore, to leave everything to fate
And to not actively contribute
To the music of the universe
Is a sign of sheer ignorance.

The music of the universe is all pervading
And it is composed on 
Forty different levels.

Your destiny is the level 
Where you will play your tune.
You might not change
Your instrument, but 
How well you play is entirely in your hands.

---

## Rule 30 : The Only One
The true Sufi is such that
Even when he is unjustly accused, attacked, 
And condemned from all sides,
he patiently endures,
Uttering not a single bad word
About any of his critics.

A Sufi never apportions blame.
how can there be opponents
Or rivals or even "others" 
When there is no "self" in the first place?

How can there be anyone to blame 
When there is only One? 

---

## Rule 31 : Expansion and softening of heart
If you want to strengthen your faith,
You will need to soften inside.
For your faith to be rock solid,
Your heart needs to be as soft as a feather.

Through an illness, accident, loss
Or Fright, one way or another,
We all are faced with incidents
That teach us how to
Become less selfish and judgmental,
And more compassionate and generous.

Yet some of us learn the lesson
And manage to become milder,
While some others end up
becoming even harsher than before.

The only way to get closer to Truth
Is to expand your heart 
So that it will encompass
All humanity and still have 
room for more Love.

---

## Rule 32 : The Fetish of the Truth
Spiritual growth is about 
The totality of our consciousness.
Not about obsessing over
particular aspects.

Nothing should stand between
Yourself and God.

Not imams, priests, rabbis,
Or any other custodians of 
Moral or religious leadership.
Not spiritual masters, 
Not even your faith.

Believe in your values and your rules,
But never lord them over others.
If you keep breaking other people's hearts,
Whatever religious duty you perform is no good.

Stay away from all sorts of idolatry,
For they will blur your vision.
Let God and only God be your guide.
Learn the Truth, 
My friend, but be careful 
Not to make fetish out of your truths.

---

## Rule 33 : Consciousness of nothingness
While everyone in this world
Strives to get somewhere 
And become someone,
Only to leave it all behind after death,
You aim for the supreme stage of nothingness.

Live this life as 
light and empty as the number zero.
We are no different from a pot.
It is not the decorations outside 
But the emptiness inside
That holds us straight.
Just like that,
It is not what we aspire to achieve
But the consciousness of nothingness 
That keeps us going. 

---

## Rule 34 : Submission to the Divine essence
Submission does not mean being weak or passive.
It leads to neither fatalism nor Capitulation.
Just the opposite. 
True power resides in submission - 
A power that comes from within.

Those who submit to the divine essence of life
Will live in unperturbed tranquillity and peace
Even when the whole wide world
Goes through turbulence after turbulence.

---

## Rule 35 : Co-existence of the Opposites within
In this world, it is not similarities 
Or regularities that take us a step forward,
But blunt opposites.

And all the opposites in the universe,
Are present within each and every one of us.
Therefore, the believer needs to meet
The unbeliever residing within.
And the non believer should get
To know the silent faithful in him.

Until the day one reaches the stage 
Of Insan-i-Kamil, the perfect human being,
Faith is a gradual process
And one that necessitates
Its seemingly opposite : Disbelief.

---

## Rule 36 : The will of God
The world is erected
Upon the principle of reciprocity.

Neither a drop of kindness
Nor a speck of evil will
Remain unreciprocated. 

Fear not the plots,
Deceptions, or tricks of other people.
If somebody is setting a trap,
Remember, so is God.

He is the biggest plotter.
Not even a leaf stirs outside
God's knowledge.

Simply and fully believe in that.
Whatsoever God does, He does beautifully.

---

## Rule 37 : God the clockmaker
God is a meticulous clockmaker.
So precise is His order 
That everything on earth happens in its own time. 
Neither a minute late or a minute early. 
And for everyone without exception,
The clock works accurately.
For each there is a time to love,
And a time to die.

---

## Rule 38 : 
Even if a single day in oyur life 
I the same as teh day before,
it surely is apity. 
At every moment and
