## 40 rules of love 

![](/assets/bookworm/40rulesoflove.jpg)

**“The Forty Rules of Love”** by **Elif Shafak** is a beautifully layered novel that weaves together two parallel narratives — one set in the **13th century**, exploring the relationship between **Rumi**, the renowned Sufi poet, and his spiritual teacher **Shams of Tabriz**, and the other in the **present day**, following **Ella Rubenstein**, a middle-aged American woman seeking meaning in her life.


### 🕊️ **1. The Contemporary Story — Ella Rubenstein**

Ella is a **housewife in her forties**, living an outwardly comfortable but emotionally hollow life in Massachusetts. Her marriage has lost passion, and she feels trapped in routine.
She takes up a job as a **reader for a literary agency** and is assigned to review a manuscript titled *"Sweet Blasphemy"* written by **A.Z. Zahara**.

As Ella reads the book — which tells the story of **Rumi and Shams** — she becomes deeply moved by its portrayal of **spiritual love**, **faith**, and **freedom**.
Through her correspondence with the mysterious author Zahara, Ella begins to awaken emotionally and spiritually, ultimately discovering **love that transcends boundaries** and **a sense of divine connection** that transforms her life.


### 🌙 **2. The Historical Story — Rumi and Shams of Tabriz**

Set in **13th-century Konya**, this narrative recounts how **Jalal ad-Din Rumi**, a respected Islamic scholar, encounters the wandering dervish **Shams of Tabriz**, whose unconventional wisdom challenges Rumi’s rigid beliefs.

Shams presents **forty spiritual rules**, each expressing a mystical aspect of **Sufi philosophy** — about **love**, **God**, and the **inner journey toward enlightenment**.
Through Shams, Rumi learns that:

* **True religion is love**, not dogma.
* **Every human being** is a reflection of the divine.
* **Pain and loss** are paths to spiritual growth.
* **God resides within**, not in the external rituals of faith.

Their friendship provokes jealousy and outrage among Rumi’s followers, ultimately leading to **Shams’s mysterious disappearance (possibly murder)** — a loss that transforms Rumi into a **poet and mystic**, pouring his grief and love into the verses of the *Masnavi*.


### 💫 **3. The Forty Rules of Love (Essence)**

While each rule has unique wisdom, they collectively emphasize:

* **Love as the path to divine union**
* **Tolerance over judgment**
* **Spiritual freedom over religious conformity**
* **Inner transformation through suffering and surrender**
* **Unity of all beings beyond creed or culture**


### ❤️ **4. Themes**

* The **transformative power of love**
* The **duality of worldly vs. divine existence**
* The **struggle between ego and spirit**
* The **connection between faith and freedom**


### 🌹 **5. Message**

The novel suggests that **every form of love — human or divine — is a step toward spiritual awakening**. It calls readers to break free from rigid structures, open their hearts, and live authentically guided by compassion and connection to the divine within.


Perfect 🌹 — here’s a **summarized version of the 40 Rules of Love** from *Elif Shafak’s* *The Forty Rules of Love*, organized by their **spiritual theme**.

Each “rule” comes from **Shams of Tabriz’s teachings**, blending **Sufi mysticism** and **universal wisdom** about love, God, and self-transformation.

### The 40 rules of love - summary 

#### 🌿 **A. Rules about God and Spirituality**

These rules emphasize that God is not found in rigid rituals or doctrines, but within the **heart and spirit** of every being.

1. **God is not in a mosque, church, or temple — He is within you and everyone around you.**

8. **Do not seek heaven or fear hell — seek only love, and you find God.**


#### 💞 **B. Rules about Love**

Love is the **central force of existence**, the path that transforms the soul. Shams teaches that **divine love** and **human love** are reflections of the same truth.

9. **Love is the essence of life — without it, we are empty.**
10. **The way to the truth is through the heart, not the intellect.**

The ego blinds us to truth. To reach divine love, one must dissolve the self.

25. **The path of love is the annihilation of the ego.**
26. **Don’t confuse power with strength — humility is the truest strength.**

30. **Let go of pride, for it blocks divine light.**
31. **A heart that is empty of ego is full of love.**
32. **Serving others purifies the soul.**


#### 🌸 **E. Rules about Truth and Tolerance**

Truth is vast and cannot be confined to one religion, culture, or identity.

33. **The path to truth is a work of the heart, not the head.**
34. **Don’t get stuck in labels — Muslim, Christian, Jew — God is beyond all.**
35. **All faiths speak the same truth in different languages.**
36. **Fanaticism kills love — stay open, humble, and kind.**
37. **The real sin is to hurt another being.**
38. **Don’t worship forms; seek the essence behind them.**
39. **Patience is key — what seems late is always on divine time.**
40. **A life without love is meaningless; love is the bridge to everything.**


#### 🌕 **Essence of All 40 Rules**

> *“Whatever happens, love is always the answer — for in love we find God, in pain we find truth, and in surrender we find peace.”*
