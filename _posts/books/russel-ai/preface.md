1. AI is the study of **intelligent agents** that receives **percepts** from the environment and takes **actions**.
2. Each such agent implements a **function** that maps **sequences of percepts** to **actions**.
3. These **functions** can be represented as -
   1. reactive agents
   2. realtime planners
   3. decision theoretic systems
   4. deep learning systems.
4. **Learning** is both
   1. A construction method for a competent system and
   2. A way to extend teh reach of the designer into unknown environments.
5. Robotics and Vision are not independently defined problems. But they occur in the service of acieving goals, as multiple agents.
