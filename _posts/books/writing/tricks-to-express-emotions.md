There’s no easy shortcut to becoming a great writer. Writing isn’t a magic trick; it’s a craft that requires continuous learning, refinement, and deep self-reflection. Writing well isn’t just about getting words on the page; it’s about carefully crafting those words so they resonate, provoke thought, and connect with readers. In fact, most writers, regardless of experience, are unknowingly making the same mistakes over and over. These aren’t necessarily the obvious ones, things like spelling or grammar, but deeper mistakes that, once addressed, can transform your writing.

In this post, we’re going to take an in-depth look at five of these common writing mistakes. Each of them is a barrier between you and truly engaging, memorable writing. And, most importantly, I’ll walk you through exercises that will help you break through these barriers, helping you become a better, more authentic writer.

Mistake 1: Not Showing, But Telling
What Does “Show, Don’t Tell” Really Mean?
The principle of “show, don’t tell” is one of the most important tools in a writer’s arsenal. But it’s also one of the hardest to master. So, let’s unpack it fully.

When we talk about “telling,” we mean that the writer is simply telling the reader information. There’s no room for imagination or emotional connection. It’s the difference between being told a fact versus experiencing the fact yourself.

Here’s an example to illustrate the difference:

Telling Example:
“She was sad.”

This sentence is simple and direct. It tells us the character’s emotional state, but it doesn’t make us feel anything. It’s informational but lacks depth. We understand that she’s sad, but we don’t understand why or how. It doesn’t evoke a reaction in the reader.

Showing Example:
“Her shoulders drooped, her eyes unfocused as they stared at the crumpled letter in her hand. She clenched her fists, but the paper slipped from her grasp, falling to the floor like a lost promise.”

In this example, the sadness is shown through the character’s body language (drooping shoulders, unfocused eyes), and the metaphorical language used (the crumpled letter and lost promise) evokes a deeper sense of loss. We feel the sadness without it being explicitly stated. We’re invited into the character’s experience, not just told about it.

Why Does “Showing” Matter?
Showing, rather than telling, engages the reader’s senses by allowing them to experience the emotion or situation firsthand. Instead of just being told what’s happening, the reader becomes immersed in the scene, feeling as if they are right there, living through it themselves. This sensory engagement pulls them deeper into the story and makes the emotions more tangible and real. By describing the sights, sounds, and physical sensations, you help the reader connect with the moment in a way that is far more impactful than simply stating the emotions or actions directly.

Moreover, showing encourages empathy. By depicting the character’s actions, reactions, and environment in detail, you give the reader the opportunity to understand not just what the character is feeling, but why they feel that way. Instead of saying “He was sad,” you show the character’s body language, their environment, and their inner turmoil, allowing the reader to step into their shoes. This creates a sense of empathy, which is essential in building a strong emotional connection with your audience. When the reader understands the character’s emotions on a deeper level, they’re more likely to care about what happens next.

Finally, showing creates a more immersive experience. Rather than the reader passively receiving information, showing invites them to become an active participant in the story. They’re not just reading words on a page; they’re visualizing the scene, hearing the sounds, and feeling the emotions. This involvement makes the narrative more engaging and meaningful, as the reader becomes a part of the story, rather than just an observer. Through vivid descriptions and sensory details, you bring the world of your writing to life, making it more dynamic and memorable.

The Mechanics of Showing: Understanding Sensory Details
To show effectively, you need to appeal to the senses. Senses are your gateway to showing, because they allow the reader to experience the environment alongside the character. A writer can evoke emotion not just by describing feelings but by describing the environment, the sounds, the smells, and the tactile sensations.

Sight: What does the character see around them? Are they overwhelmed by the brightness of a room, or do their eyes focus on something specific, like an object or another character?

Sound: Does the environment have a certain ambience? Maybe there’s a distant hum, the creak of floorboards, or the sound of silence. Is there a ringing in the character’s ears or an unsettling noise that adds to the mood?

Touch: What sensations does the character feel? A cold breeze, a sweaty hand, a tight chest, these sensory details convey emotion without saying the word “sad” or “angry.”

Taste and Smell: These are more subtle but incredibly powerful. A sour taste in the mouth when nervous, the comforting smell of a favorite food, or the pungent odor of something decaying, these sensations carry emotion with them.

How to “Show” Emotions Like Sadness, Joy, Fear, and Anger
Sadness:
Instead of just saying “she was sad,” consider how sadness manifests physically and mentally. The body betrays sadness through things like slumped shoulders, slow movements, a foggy gaze, or sighs. The environment can also reflect the sadness, perhaps the character is surrounded by dim lighting, a messy room, or a quiet, still atmosphere.

Example of showing sadness:
“She wiped the tear from her cheek, though it didn’t make a difference. The pillow beneath her head had long since soaked up all her tears, and now her eyes were dry, hollow. Her hands trembled as she closed the book in front of her, the words now blurred together like fragments of a dream she couldn’t remember.”

Notice how the sadness is shown not just through the action of crying, but through physical sensations (trembling hands), the environment (the soaked pillow), and the mental state (blurred words).

Joy:
Joy, too, is more than just saying someone is happy. It’s in the lightness of the body, the sparkle in the eyes, the way the person might move or laugh. It can also be shown through the environment, such as bright colors, lively sounds, or energetic actions.

Example of showing joy:
“She laughed out loud, the sound filling the room like sunlight spilling across the floor. Her eyes were wide, her mouth spread in a grin that felt foreign but right, as if her face hadn’t made that expression in years. The warmth of the room matched the heat of her cheeks as she spun around, her feet barely touching the ground.”

Joy is often about the energy of the person, how they interact with their environment and others. It’s about how their physicality and surroundings reflect the emotion.

Fear:
Fear is visceral. It’s the quickening pulse, the tightening chest, the shaky hands. It’s the cold sweat, the nervous glance over the shoulder, the overwhelming need to run or hide. Showing fear can also mean showing how the world around the character feels distorted, sounds too loud, and shadows too long.

Example of showing fear:
“Her breath hitched as the door creaked, louder than it should have. The room felt smaller now, the shadows longer. Her hands were cold, sweat beading at the back of her neck. The floor seemed to groan beneath her feet, every step too loud, too heavy. She froze, her heart pounding in her chest like it was trying to escape.”

Fear is often shown through physical discomfort and sensory overload. The world closes in on the character, and they are hyper-aware of every sensation, every movement.

Anger:
Anger is in the clenched jaw, the fast-paced breath, the burning sensation in the face or fists. It’s the way the character might move fast, erratic, sharp. Anger changes the environment, too, like the character’s voice growing louder or their movements becoming jerky.

Example of showing anger:
“His hands clenched into fists, the skin over his knuckles pulled tight as if he were holding something back. His breath came in shallow, sharp bursts, and his chest heaved with every exhale. The words he spoke were low, but each one felt like a slap, sharper than the last. He turned away, unable to face her, his jaw clenched so tightly it was as if he could crack the bones.”

Anger often translates into tightness in the body muscles locking up, teeth gritting, fists clenching. The environment may also become more tense, with more abrupt or jerky movements.

Exercise 1: Show, Don’t Tell
Practice showing various emotions by using sensory details and body language.

Step 1: Select four strong emotions that you’ve felt recently (e.g., sadness, joy, fear, anger). Write down each emotion, and think deeply about the physical sensations you experienced when you felt them. How did your body feel? How did the environment around you change?

Step 2: For each emotion, write a short paragraph where you simply show the emotion. Use as many sensory details as you can. What did you see? What did you hear? What did you feel physically?

Step 3: Now, go back and revise one of your paragraphs. Add more detail. Make sure the environment, the body language, and the sensory details are rich enough to fully immerse the reader.

Step 4: Once you’ve completed the paragraph, read it aloud. Can you feel the emotion yourself? Does it create an image or feeling for you? Does it feel authentic?

By diving deep into each emotion and showing them through physical and sensory details, you can move beyond just writing facts. You’ll begin to evoke powerful emotional experiences in your readers, helping them connect with your writing in a way that is visceral, real, and unforgettable.

Mistake 2: Overloading with Adjectives and Adverbs
When we’re trying to paint a vivid picture in our writing, we often lean heavily on adjectives and adverbs. But overloading your writing with them can actually weaken your prose. Why? Because:

Adjectives and adverbs can dilute meaning by taking up space without adding anything essential to your writing. Instead of getting straight to the heart of what you’re trying to convey, they fill the sentence with unnecessary clutter. This excess of words makes your writing less direct and harder for the reader to engage with, as it masks the core idea beneath a layer of embellishments.

Additionally, relying too heavily on adjectives and adverbs can make your writing feel passive. Strong, specific nouns and verbs are what truly drive action and emotion in a sentence. Instead of painting a clear picture of what’s happening or what someone is feeling, adjectives and adverbs often describe things in a way that feels indirect or weak. When you focus on powerful nouns and verbs, your writing becomes active, and the meaning is communicated with much greater force.

Another problem with overusing adjectives and adverbs is that they can be repetitive. Often, you might find yourself saying the same thing multiple times, but with slight variations. For example, instead of describing something as “extremely beautiful” or “incredibly amazing,” the word “beautiful” or “amazing” alone could carry the necessary weight. Repeating the same idea in different ways doesn’t add value; it only slows down the flow of your writing and can make the sentence feel redundant. By stripping away unnecessary modifiers, you allow the core meaning to come through more clearly and concisely.

Why Does Overuse of Adjectives and Adverbs Weaken Your Writing?
Imagine looking at a painting with too many colors. While each individual color may be beautiful, when you mix them all together, the overall image becomes muddy, and it’s hard to focus on the important details. The same happens with writing when you add too many adjectives and adverbs.

When you overdo it with details, you risk obscuring the focus of your writing. Too many descriptors can overwhelm the reader, pulling their attention in multiple directions and distracting them from the key point or emotion you’re trying to convey. The more you layer on unnecessary details, the harder it becomes for your audience to grasp what really matters in your story or message.

In addition to this, you lose precision. When you flood a sentence with adjectives and adverbs, the image you’re trying to create becomes muddled and less vivid. Instead of painting a clear, sharp picture, your description turns into a vague, general blur. What could be a strong and impactful moment gets diluted because the excess words don’t offer any new or meaningful information, they just create confusion.

Finally, you water down the impact of your writing. Extra adjectives and adverbs don’t make your writing more powerful; they make it harder to understand. The true meaning of what you’re trying to say gets lost in a sea of fluff. By simplifying and focusing your language, you allow the core message to resonate with more strength and clarity, making it far more impactful.

Example of Overloaded Writing
Let’s take a look at a sentence that’s overloaded with adjectives and adverbs.

Overloaded Sentence:
“The old, dark, crumbling, spooky house stood on the lonely, desolate hill, with the frayed, faded curtains hanging loosely in the cold, biting wind, swaying slowly back and forth as the pale, eerie moonlight crept slowly through them.”

This sentence contains several adjectives and adverbs that are not only excessive but also vague. Let’s break it down:

Old, dark, crumbling, spooky, lonely, desolate, frayed, faded, loose, cold, biting, slowly, pale, eerie, these are all adjectives and adverbs attempting to describe the house, the hill, the wind, and the moonlight.

The issue here isn’t just the number of adjectives and adverbs. It’s that many of these words don’t add anything substantial to the core image of the house or the scene. Rather than making the description feel richer, the overuse of descriptive words causes clutter and confusion. It becomes a long list of vague descriptors instead of a sharp, vivid picture.

How to Fix It:
Now let’s strip this down to its essentials. We’ll use stronger, more specific nouns and verbs, and focus on showing the scene more clearly with fewer words.

Revised Version:
“The house stood on the hill, its windows dark and empty. The wind tugged at the curtains, making them flutter like ghosts in the night.”

Notice how the revised version is much cleaner and clearer. We’ve cut out unnecessary adjectives and adverbs and replaced them with more precise imagery. Here’s what we changed:

“Old, dark, crumbling, spooky” —> “The house” (already implies age and condition)

“Lonely, desolate hill” —> “The hill” (doesn’t need extra descriptors)

“Frayed, faded curtains” —> “The curtains” (the word “curtains” is enough to suggest wear, and the focus is now on the action of the wind tugging at them)

“Cold, biting wind” —> “The wind” (the action of the wind is more important than specifying its temperature)

“Swaying slowly back and forth” —> “Flutter like ghosts” (a more evocative metaphor that shows the eerie motion)

This revised sentence is more focused and evocative, using fewer words to create a stronger, clearer image. Instead of saying everything directly, we’ve given the reader just enough detail to imagine the scene, and the simplicity of it makes it more powerful.

When to Use Adjectives and Adverbs (The Right Way)
While adjectives and adverbs are necessary in writing, the key is using them intentionally and not relying on them to carry your entire sentence. Here’s how to use them effectively:

Use strong nouns and verbs: Whenever possible, replace adjectives and adverbs with stronger nouns or verbs. A good noun or verb can convey more meaning than several adjectives or adverbs put together. For example, instead of saying “the very beautiful painting,” you could say “the stunning painting.”

Choose specificity over quantity: Instead of listing multiple adjectives to describe something, choose the one that is most specific and impactful. Think about what you want your reader to feel and focus on that one word. For example, instead of saying “the small, quiet, dark room,” say “the cramped room.”

Use adjectives and adverbs to enhance, not carry the image: Adjectives and adverbs should add depth to your writing, not define it. The core image should be strong on its own, and these descriptive words should just fill in the details.

Exercise 2: Streamlining Your Writing
Practice writing more effectively and concisely by using fewer, stronger descriptive words.

Step 1: Pick a scene or object you’ve recently observed, whether it’s a place, a person, or an event. Write a detailed paragraph about it using as many adjectives and adverbs as possible. Don’t worry about overdoing it at first, just let your creativity flow.

Example: Write about a stormy night you remember, describing the wind, rain, the sky, the atmosphere, etc.

Step 2: Now, go back through your paragraph and cut out half of the adjectives and adverbs. For every one you remove, try replacing it with a stronger, more specific noun or verb. This might involve using metaphors, similes, or more active descriptions to replace the extra words.

Example: Instead of saying, “the cold, violent wind blew furiously,” you could say, “the wind howled, biting at her skin.”

Step 3: Reread your new version. Does it feel more focused and impactful? Does the sentence feel sharper and clearer? How does it read now compared to the original, more cluttered version?

Step 4: Read your revised paragraph aloud. Does it flow better? Can you feel the atmosphere more clearly with fewer words? What’s the effect of focusing on one strong image instead of layering many?

The overuse of adjectives and adverbs is a common pitfall, but once you learn to streamline your writing, you’ll find your words become far more powerful and precise. By focusing on strong nouns and active verbs, you’ll let the strength of your writing shine through without cluttering it up with unnecessary detail.

Mastering this skill will not only make your writing clearer and more vivid, but it will also make your prose feel more dynamic and engaging. The next time you sit down to write, remember: Don’t use five adjectives when one strong word will do. Simplify, focus, and let your writing breathe.

Mistake 3: Not Finding Your Unique Voice
What Is “Voice” in Writing, and Why Is It So Important?
Your voice as a writer is more than just how you string words together. It’s the personality and perspective that come through in your writing, the tone, the rhythm, the way you express thoughts and emotions. It’s what makes your writing distinct and memorable. Think of it like the difference between hearing a song by your favorite artist and hearing a cover of the same song. Both may use the same notes, but the original has a certain flavor, uniqueness, and soul that the cover version can’t replicate.

Your voice is about authenticity. When you write in your own voice, it’s like you’re speaking directly to the reader, not using clichés, not imitating someone else’s style, and not trying to sound like what you think people want to read. Your voice reflects who you are, your thoughts, your perspective, and your personal style.

Why Do Writers Struggle to Find Their Voice?
Many writers struggle to find their voice, especially early on. Here are a few common reasons why:

New writers often feel the pressure to sound like the writers they admire or mimic the style of those whose work is published in popular outlets. This desire to fit in can lead to imitation, rather than cultivating an authentic voice. Additionally, the fear of judgment can prevent writers from expressing their true selves. They may worry that their voice will sound too raw, too unrefined, or too vulnerable, opting instead for a safer style that lacks the depth and personality of their true voice. Overthinking also plays a significant role in stifling a writer’s unique voice. Writers may become obsessed with perfecting their writing, trying to craft sentences that sound “just right,” rather than letting their natural style emerge. Lastly, developing a unique voice takes time, and like any skill, it requires consistent practice and experimentation. Writers may need to go through trial and error before finding the expression that feels most true to them.

How Do You Know If You Have Found Your Voice?
The moment you find your voice, your writing will start to feel natural and unforced. It will have a rhythm and cadence that’s uniquely yours. Your words will flow easily, and you’ll feel an emotional connection to what you’re writing. It won’t feel like you’re “trying” to sound like anyone else. It will feel authentic and alive.

Characteristics of a unique writing voice:

Authenticity: It feels like you’re speaking directly to the reader in your natural way.

Tone: It matches the mood you want to create whether it’s casual, serious, humorous, or reflective.

Pacing and Rhythm: The way your sentences flow. Are they long and meandering? Short and punchy? This reflects your personality.

Word Choice: The specific words you choose reflect your personal experiences, background, and worldview.

Example of Writing Without a Clear Voice
Impersonal Writing (Lack of Voice):

“It was a beautiful day, and the sun shone brightly in the sky. People walked along the street, smiling and laughing. The trees swayed gently in the breeze.”

This passage reads like a generic description. There’s nothing in the writing that sets it apart. The observations are surface-level and lack depth, and there’s no personal perspective coming through. It could be anyone’s writing.

Writing With a Unique Voice
Example of Writing With a Unique Voice:

“The sun bathed the street in warm light, and I couldn’t help but feel that it had been forever since I’d walked outside. The world felt different today full of possibilities. People passed by, but they weren’t strangers. They were like me, just trying to figure it out, their faces soft in the sun’s glow.”

In this version, we see a personal reflection embedded in the description. The narrator is actively engaging with the scene, reflecting on how it makes them feel, and even subtly revealing something about themselves. This creates a connection between the reader and the narrator, as the writing feels personal and meaningful. The tone is reflective, and the word choice gives the reader a glimpse into the narrator’s worldview. The unique voice emerges through their observations, emotions, and perspective.

How to Find Your Unique Voice
Finding your voice is a process. It’s not something that happens with just one or two exercises, but by writing regularly, experimenting, and being authentic to yourself. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you discover and refine your voice:

To truly find your unique voice, start by embracing your natural style. Don’t worry about trying to sound like someone else. Write the way you speak. When you lean into your natural patterns of speech, your authentic voice will shine through. If humor is a part of who you are, let it flow. If you’re more introspective, allow those reflections to come through in your writing. If you’re passionate about something, let that passion shape your tone and pacing. Writing from a place of vulnerability is also key to unlocking your true voice. Don’t be afraid to express your emotions, doubts, and experiences. When you allow yourself to be open, your writing will naturally become more compelling and authentic.

A powerful exercise to help you connect with your voice is to read your work aloud. Hearing it will allow you to gauge whether it feels natural or forced. Does it sound like you’re talking to a friend, or does it feel overly formal or stiff? By listening, you can identify whether your true self is coming through in your writing.

Experimentation also plays an important role in finding your voice. Don’t be afraid to try different writing styles, tones, or genres. Whether it’s a short story, a personal essay, or even poetry, each format challenges your voice in different ways and helps you refine it further. Through experimentation, you’ll begin to discover the nuances of your writing that feel the most authentic.

Lastly, write from the heart. Stop worrying about what you think will sound “good” or “proper.” Instead, write about what excites you, what frustrates you, or what makes you feel vulnerable. The more you write about things that matter to you, the more your unique voice will emerge and be heard.

Exercise 3: Finding Your Voice
Practice writing in your unique voice by reflecting on something personal and using your own perspective to express it.

Step 1: Choose a personal topic
Pick something that’s meaningful to you. It could be a personal experience, a memory, a hobby, a piece of music, a place, or an event that has shaped you. It could even be something you’ve noticed or experienced recently that triggered a strong emotion.

Example topics:

A moment that made you feel truly alive

A place that holds significant memories for you

A life lesson you’ve learned the hard way

Something that made you laugh uncontrollably

Step 2: Write without worrying about the “right” way
Begin writing without concern for how it sounds or whether it’s “perfect.” Just let the words flow. Let your voice come through naturally. Don’t filter your thoughts or hold back. Write in the way that feels most comfortable and natural to you. If it feels like you’re speaking directly to someone, that’s a good sign.

Step 3: Read it aloud
After writing, read your piece aloud. Listen for your voice. Does it sound like you? Does it feel authentic? Can you hear your personality, your tone, and your thoughts in the writing? If not, go back and revise it.

Step 4: Revise to make it more personal
Now, go back and revise the piece to make it even more personal. Experiment with phrasing and sentence structure to reflect the way you speak or think. You can change the tone to be more casual or add more introspection, humor, or vulnerability, depending on what feels right for you.

Step 5: Reflect on the process
After revising, reflect on how it felt to write this piece in your natural voice. What did you learn about your writing style? Did you discover any patterns in how you express yourself? Did you find it easy or difficult to write authentically?

Your voice is the soul of your writing. It’s what makes your words authentic, memorable, and powerful. By embracing your unique perspective, experimenting with tone, and writing from the heart, you can discover and refine your voice. It’s a process that takes time, but the more you write, the clearer your voice will become.

Finding your voice isn’t about writing like someone else; it’s about discovering how you express yourself. So, let go of the fear of judgment, stop imitating, and start writing from the heart. Your voice is waiting to be discovered.
