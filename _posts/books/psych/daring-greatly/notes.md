# daring greatly

1. We get moral courage and we **dare greatly** when we **allow** ourselves to be **seen**, **without caring** what other people might think. And if we do not me ourselves seen, anyways the other people will superimpose on us, what they think we are. So, we actually do not gain anything by keeping things open to interpretations. We allow ourselves to be seen by speaking up, and by engaging in conversations. 
   - **sharing** something we have created, is a perfect example of daring greatly. And share it fully, completely, with the context, so anyone can understand it. if you keep it cryptic, and have not invested much on how it will be perceived by others, then you actually are not connecting and caring for them. 
      - it is a **vulnerable** but **essential** part of **engaged and wholehearted living**
      - we strip away the most creative and innovative touches to make revealing to our friends a **less risky** experience.
      - or we share the art in its most creative and innovative form, and get **crushed** when the reception doesn't meet our expectations.
   2. Shame stops us from **trying**, from sharing. It tells us that we are **not good enough**.
2. **Shame resilience**
   1. What is our desire ? To be appreciated of our **creations.**.
   2. But our identity extends beyond the work we produce and our endeavors. they reflect our actions, not our essence per-se.
