### Introduction - heart of daring leadership

1. **COURAGE** : Embrace the suck - you cannot get courage without rumbling with vulnerability.
   1. Rumbling - A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by 
      1. a commitment to lean into vulnerability.
      2. stay curious and generous, to stay with the messy middle of problem identification and sloving.
      3. take a break and circle back when necessary.
      4. to be fearless in owning our parts
      5. listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard.
      6. serve the work, each other, not our egos.
   2. Courage is a collection of 4 skill sets that can be taught, observed and measured. in sequence
      1. rumbling with vulnerability
         1. foundational
      2. living into our values
      3. braving trust
      4. learning to rise
2. **SELF AWARENESS** : Who we are is how we lead. **Self love** and **self awareness** matters.
   1. Fear always exists. it is all about how we respond to fear.
   2. **Barriers** to courage : **Armour**  - The thoughts, emotions and behaviors we use to protect ourselves when we aren't *willing* and able to *rumble* with vulnerability.
3. **CULTURE of Courage** : Courage is contagious.
   1. We need people to fully show up, to bring their whole selves, including their unarmored whole hearts so that they can innovate, solve problems and serve people. This can happen when we create a culture in which people feel **safe, seen, heard and respected.**
      1. people should be able to walk in and take off the **crushing weight of their armour**, hang it on the rack, and open their heart to truly being seen.
   2. Daring leaders needs to be **connected** with and **care** for the people they lead. These are **irreducible requirements** for wholehearted and productive relationships between leader and team members. Fire the leader who cannot connect!
   3. as leaders we must create and hold spaces that rise to a **higher standard** than what we see around.
   4. **Armoring behaviors** that makes innovating work an impossibility. It is a very heavy to carry our armour and is a very big energy and time leak.
      1. blaming
      2. shaming
      3. emotional stoicism
      4. cynicism
      5. perfectionism

### 1.1. The moment and the myths
1. Key lessons 
   1. Physics of vulnerability - if we brave enough, **often enough**, we will fall. Daring is not saying - "i'm willing to risk failure". But it is about saying, "i know i will eventually fail and **i'm still all in**." It is an awareness that disappointment, failure and heartbreaks are inevitable.
   2. Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It is having the courage to show up when you can't control the outcome. The definition of vulnerability as the emotion that we experience during times of **uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure**.

        A --> D[Emotional Exposure]
    ```
   3. **cheap-seat feedback** - If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, Iâ€™m not interested in or open to your feedback. Avoid cheap feedbacks and remain armor free.
      1. what is unproductive, hurtful, drop at the feet of your unarmored self.
      2. No matter how much your self doubt wants to scoop up the criticism and snuggle with the negativity so it can confirm its worst fears, or
      3. how eager your shame gremlins are to use the hurt to fortify your armor,
      4. Take a deep breath and find the strength to leave what is mean spirited on the ground. you don't even need to stomp it and kick it away.
      5. Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit. It does not deserve your energy or engagement. Just step over the comments and keep daring, always remembering that armor is too heavy a price to pay to engage with cheap-seat feedback.
   4. **the balancing act** - Sealing heart not just from hurt, **but from love** - if we engage with all feedbacks including the ill spirited ones, it would hurt us more. if we armor ourselves pretending it does not hurt, we disconnect from vulnerability and emotion so fully that we stop feeling hurt. That is the place where the armor is so thick that we don't feel anything. there was experience death. **Cowards die many times before death!** so spake Shakespeare. We have paid for self protection by sealing off our heart from everyone and from everything - not just hurt, but love.
   5. **certainty of heart wringing** - *by CS Lewis* - To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will **certainly** be **wrung** and possibly be **broken**. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket - safe, dark, motionless, airless - it will change. It will not be broken; it will become ubreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. **To love is to be vulnerable.**
   6. **Square quad** : Choose people who love you not **despite** your imperfections and vulnerabilities. But **because** of them.
