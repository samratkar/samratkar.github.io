1. Practice of Love as an art 20/04/2019, 00:28:38
  As in every art, or for that matter in any domain, if you want to reach an expertise, you need to following the following systematically -
  A - any art or domain
    i- Discipline
    ii- Concentration
    iii- Patience
    iv - Supreme concern to master the art / domain
    v - Indirect nature
    vi - Relaxed awareness towards malfunctionality.
  B - for Love
    vi - Objectivity : Opposite to narcissism. A narcissist sees the world outside, as symbols of his inner world, as his creation, like what we do in our dreams. In the dream we produce events, we stage dramas, which are the expression of our wishes and fears. An insane person or the ddreamer fails completely in having an objective view of the world outside; but al of us are more or less insane, or more or less asleep; all of us have an unobjective view of the world, one which is distorted by our narcissistic orientation.
    vii - Humility is required to be objective.
    viii - Rational faith / Intuition / belief on the other and the self is required to be humble. Any long term relationship is a leap of faith.
    ix - Courage is required to have faith.
    x - Inner and outer activity and vitality
    xi - Beyond fairness
    x - Possibility of love as a social phenomenon.
