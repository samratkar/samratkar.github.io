## The best ride

Mercedes E Class, and Mohd Siddique! 
Few life lessons I learnt from Mr. Siddique - 

1. You define your role. Role does not define you. 
2. Kindness is more important that righteousness. 
3. Maintain your niche-ness
4. Life might give your lemons. You can always make lemonades our of them. 
5. Know your priorities. And be sincere to them.
6. Sometimes a strong sense of morality makes things simpler in life. A sense of black and white. Right and wrong. (Although I derive pleasure in diving into the shades of grey)
7. Never forget from where you have come, no matter where you go.

## The Dinner stroll 

Beautiful roads, 
Naman path - named the spacious walkways by the roads,
Sitting benches spread across,
Saw a very old couple well dressed for the dinner date,
Sitting at the bus stop, 
Waiting for the bus. 
Metro side of the hotel,
The city well knit together,
By the tapestry of metros, bus, trains and taxis.
Great public transport! 
Belonging to the European League!

## The chocolate doll

Complimentary doll of milk and chocolate,

A welcome gift, 
A kind gesture!

## Anochecer - transition into dusk

When night is not known
What is just known is the transition to dusk
Yes, Anochecer
Is what we know in Spain!
