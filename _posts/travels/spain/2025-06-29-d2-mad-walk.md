## Keshav - Show us the path!

Lovely walk through the city, guided by Naman!  
It was like his second nature 
Seamlessly navigating through the intricate network of the metro lines 
crisscrossing of the teeming madrid city.
It was fun, getting the markup done in the map from the guest assistant at the hotel,
Then, buying a day long metro pass,
and then, doing a hopping from one station to the other,
And then walking through the beautiful graffiti adorned streets of Madrid.
The walk was a blend of history, culture, and modernity. 
The fascinating magnanimous architecture of the Royal Palace,
The breath-taking views of the Renaissance style painting on the ceilings,
The grandeur of Royal Chapel,
And then the gastronomic delight of the tapas at the local bar,
The country style pizza, the visit at the Carrefour.
Buying souvenirs, and the most fun of all, pulling each other‚Äôs leg.
It was a fun day long exploration of a beautiful city, Madrid.

## Indian food is where the soul lies

How long will you keep an Indian heart away from Biryani?
So, here we were at the Indian restaurant at night - Udaipur.
Lovely food, An ambiance done too much with colorful satins 
flowers,  feathers & frills hanging,
And the best was the 90s bollywood music!
Sitting crisscross, indulging into the homely familiarity of 
tapping into the beats of bollywood,
Enjoying Biryani, palak panner, naan, daal makhani 
after the day long of exploration of the new and novel,
Was a heart warming culmination of the day.

The sheer size and grandeur of the stadium was jaw-dropping.

With the sincere love and longing of Naman for the game, for Ronaldo, for Real Madrid!  
The visit was adorned by the throbbing passions of the fans,  
The wonder-struck faces of the fans,  
The memorabilia, the trophies, the history of the club,  
And that that awe-inspiring presence of the celebration of the sheer human spirit for excellence!  
It was a surreal experience,  
And the best part was that we were part of the journey,  
A journey that was so meaningful and important for Naman.  
Learnt a lot about the Real Madrid club, its history, its legacy,  
Through Naman's patient and passionate narration to all of us!  
Loved every bit of it.  
The celebration was joined live by Arshia through video call,  
And it culminated with the awe-struck eyes of Pooja's kids through video call,  
It was like a family celebration of the collective love for the game,   
And the love for the club, and above all appreciation of sheer human spirit for excellence!
