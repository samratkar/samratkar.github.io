The team at Spain have been so warm and welcoming. It feels like we have been friends for a lifetime.   
Today was which took the delight of food and friendship to a new level.

The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was so warm and inviting.
Learnt about the local cuisine and several dishes I had never known before.

## Acueducto de Segovia

It was a great ride to the restaurants, talking to the team and sharing stories. Came to know about the Aquaduct, which are ancient structures built to transport water from one place to another. They are often made of stone or brick and can be quite impressive in size and design. During the ancient times these were used to utilize gravity to let the water flow using slope, having the structures produce differential heights to let the water flow from one place to another. The differential heights will not be visible due to huge height of the structures.

## Great roads and network of subways and freeways

The ride to the restaurants was smooth and fast. The city is interconnected with not only a rich network of metro and subways, but also huge freeways crisscrossing the city. It was a delight seeing great architecture of medieval Spain so well maintained and preserved in the city centers. Great architecture and a delightful visual treat.
