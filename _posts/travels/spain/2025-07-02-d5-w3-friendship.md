## The jazz of connection   

When you work in the backdrop of jazz,  
When you connect heart to heart,  
When you speak, and your soul pours out,   
When you listen, and glimpse another soul,   
So perfect, so pretty!

## The surge of belonging   

When you encounter a sudden epiphany   
Of an overpowering surge of belonging,  
When you see yourself so seamlessly connected  
Connected with the other,  
When you hold their hand,   
And stand by them, and they stand by you.

## The talisman of togetherness  

When the mind is without fear,   
and the head is held high,  
Where the heart is set out wild,  
When there is nothing to hide,   
When there is nothing to fear,  
Like kindred spirits,  
You frolic, you dance, you sing, you play,  
The moment stops, the noise quietens,  
And you can hear your breath, and theirs,  
Binding yourself to them, and they to yours,  
In breath, in presence, in thoughts, in love.

## When the conversations flows  

When all starts with that 
Intricate connection of golden dots, 
sparkling gold on the bottle beautiful.

when the passion of football, 
Leads to the passion for fitness and wellbeing.
When the nurture of the soma,
Leads to the care of the psyche,
When you get goosebumps on the care one takes
To remind themselves of the immaculate and immortal -
The temperance, courage, justice, wisdom,
Beautifying and giving meaning to the moral. 

---

## The resonance of souls 

When you discover their music 
resonating with yours,
And your own ideals, your own masters, 
Your own struggles, you own brokenness,
Sharing space with theirs!
When you and they do not exist in separation,
Rather we all blend into purple one, 
Seamlessly merging their red with your blue.  

---

## The nostalgia, the familiarity  

When you feel the nostalgia,
When your long forgotten authors,
Spring up in their sharing,
When you get a glimpse of your own naked self,
In their own pure symphony from soul,
When you become they, and they you.
When you bow down in obeisance and awe,
To the vast ocean of the mysteries of the life.

## The rain of belonging, the shower of love

And then when we join hands, body and soul,
When we dance, we sing, and we laugh,
When our cheeks ache, tears trickle from corners of our eyes,
When heart feels light, and the soul is at peace.

Huge buildings in white, blue and red,
Immaculate art, graffiti, aesthetics,
High domes, and the arches,
The statues and the fountains,
The brick roads, the cobbled streets,
The golden dusk, and the twinkling night,

The angels, gods, and the saints,
With the cello, the saxophone, the flute 
Walk with us, in unison,
Tap with our feet, sway with our hands,
And we dance, we sing, we laugh,
Being drenched in the fresh, rejuvenating rain 
The rain of belonging, the shower of love.
